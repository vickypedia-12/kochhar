Vs. M/s\nSPML Infra.

BACKGROUND FACTS\nThe Hon’ble Supreme Court was hearing an appeal from an order passed by the\nHon’ble Delhi High Court3, where the Hon’ble High Court had appointed an arbitrator\non an application under Section 11(6) of the Act. Before the Hon’ble Supreme Court,\nNTPC Ltd. raised a contention that there were no existing disputes in view of a\nsettlement arrived between the parties.\nII.

Durga Trading Corporation (2021) 2 SCC 1; BSNL and Anr. v. Nortel Networks India\n(P) Ltd. (2021) 5 SCC 738; Secunderabad Cantonment Board v. B. Ramachandraiah & Sons (2021) 5 SCC 705\n1 | Pa g e(a) The jurisdiction of the courts under Section 11(6) of the Act is narrow and the\ncourts have to thoroughly examine the existence and the validity of an arbitration\nagreement (which includes an inquiry as to the parties to the agreement) and\napplicant’s privity to the said agreement.\n(b) The courts need to adjudicate the issue of non- arbitrability of the dispute.\n(c) The courts may reject claims which are manifestly and ex-facie non-arbitrable.\n(d) The courts must not undertake full review of contested facts.\n(e) The courts need to examine whether the assertion on arbitrability is bona fide or\nnot.\n(f) The courts must prima facie reach a conclusion that the claim is non-arbitrable.\nHowever, in case of doubt the dispute is to be referred to arbitration.\n(g) The courts must protect the parties from being forced to arbitrate when the matter\non the face of it is non-arbitrable.\nBasis the above, the Hon’ble Supreme Court held that the Section 11 application filed\nby SPML before the Hon’ble High Court was not bona fide and there were no pending\nclaims between the parties for submission to arbitration.\nThe Hon’ble Supreme Court further held that SPML’s case is an attempt to initiate ex-\nfacie, meritless and dishonest litigation and accordingly set aside the order passed by\nthe Hon’ble High Court.\nIII. CONCLUSION\nThe present case law passed by the Hon’ble Supreme Court is a move in the right\ndirection to curtail the reference of every matter to arbitration since the general\ntendency of the courts was to allow Section 11(6) applications and leave the parties\nto challenge the jurisdiction of the arbitrator by way of filing a Section 16 application\nunder the Act in the arbitration proceedings. However, with the above guidelines and\nclarifications, the courts would be more cautious while dealing with Section 11(6)\napplications and the claims which are frivolous and untenable would be knocked down.\n___________\n2 | Pa g e"}
{"Title": "Protection of Unregistered Global Brands in India", "Publication_Date": "29 November 2023", "URL": "https://kochhar.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Kochhar-Co.-Bangalore.-Article-by-Lynn-Lazaro-and-Aparna-Venkat-Protection-of-Unregistered-Global-Brands-in-India-Nov-2023-.pdf", "Content": "Protection of Unregistered Global Brands in India\nBy Lynn Lazaro and Aparna Venkat November 2023\nINTRODUCTION\nIndia, being a common law country, enjoys certain privileges when it comes to\nTrademark Law. In addition to priority rights for “first to use”, and the remedy of\n“passing off’’ for unregistered marks, there exists another age-old common-law\nright, not typically considered in global strategy - the transborder reputation of an\nextra territorial trademark. One does wonder, in this flat world, global market\nscenario, how trademark rights can still remain territorial and protected only in the\njurisdiction of commercial use. Given that almost all brands today have an online\npresence, accessible to anyone in the world, enforcement in a territory with no\ncommercial presence has always been the greatest challenge for rights holders.\nTransborder reputation of a trademark is when the reputation of the mark in a\nspecific geographic territory is so strong, it is said to transcend the jurisdiction from\nwhich it originates and spills over to another country where it may not be in use.\nThe modes of communication, the reputation of a product/ service can easily\ntranscend territorial limits due to promotions, advertisements, commercial publicity\nand international market presence. Several marks, despite not being marketed or\nused in India have obtained judicial protection under the common law of passing\noff. Indian courts have been keen to protect globally recognized brands from the\npassing off of their marks and counterfeit products in India. However, to establish\nreputation, the claimant would have to demonstrate that the trade and the public in\nIndia, associate the mark in question with its source or manufacturer.\nBACKGROUND\nIn 1986, in Centron Industrial Alliance Limited v. Gillette UK Limited, Gillette alleged\nthat Centron infringed its trademark 7 O’Clock for safety razor blades. Due to\ngovernment restrictions, import of the 7 O’Clock razors to India was not permitted\npost 1958. In 1984, Gillette collaborated with an Indian company for the\nmanufacture and sale of its razors in India. In 1985, Gillette learned that the\ndefendants were using a deceptively similar mark “7-Up” on safety razors. The\nCourt noted that, publicity related to a consumer article, namely, safety razors, is\nnot generated merely by advertisements in India since such goods are advertised\nin foreign newspapers and magazines, having circulation in India. Additionally, it\nwas noted by the Court that, a large number of Indians who visit other countries\nwould have had the opportunity to use Gillette’s 7 O’CLOCK razors. In view of this,\nthe Bombay High Court protected Gillette’s rights.\nPage 1 of 4In 1988, in the case of Kamal Trading Co. Vs. Gillette UK Limited, the Bombay High\nCourt restrained the usage of the 7 O’ Clock mark for toothbrushes due to the\nreputation of the mark with respect to the Respondent’s products i.e., razors and\nshaving creams. The Court, while expressing dissatisfaction, noted that goodwill\nand reputation do not fade out simply due to the product not being available in the\ncountry.\nDuring arguments, one of the UK decisions in Anheuser-Busch Inc. v. Budejovicky\nBudvar N P (“Budweiser case”) was cited in the matter that held that Budweiser\nbeer was sold only to English military and diplomatic establishments and that these\nsporadic sales could not be construed as business by the plaintiff in England to\nentitle itself for an injunction. Notably, the English law follows the territoriality\nprinciple which stems from the understanding that although a mark may have global\nreputation, it cannot earn goodwill of the consumers in a certain jurisdiction if they\nhaven’t bought/used the product associated with that mark. The Bombay High\nCourt rejected the ratio therein and expressed its dissent from the English hard-line\n“territoriality” approach to passing off claims.\nIn 1991, a single judge of the Delhi High Court in Apple Computer Inc. vs. Apple\nLeasing, injuncted a local defendant from using the word “APPLE”, “APPLE\nCOMPUTER”, and its variations, including the deceptively similar device of a half-\nbitten apple as that of the plaintiff, for computer education services or otherwise in\nthe course of trade. The plaintiff had no business in India at the time due to import\nrestrictions. The plaintiff made out a prima facie case by proving balance of\nconvenience.\nThe Delhi High Court in Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association v. Blue Cross\nHealth Clinic, 1990 granted an ex-parte injunction relief on the ground that there\nwas an international reputation of the plaintiff's mark although there was no\nregistration or use of the said trademark in India.\nFrom here on, the doctrine of transborder reputation evolved multi-fold and\nestablished the below precedents.\nPRESENT LAW\nThe doctrine of trans-border reputation was recognized for the first time in detail by\nthe Supreme Court (SC), in N.R. Dongre V. Whirlpool Corporation Ltd., (1996)\n5SCC 714. The Court held that the actual sale in India is not necessary for a plaintiff\nto establish its goodwill and reputation in India. Further, the court said that “a\nproduct and its trade name transcends the physical boundaries of a geographical\nregion and acquires a trans-border or overseas or extra-territorial reputation not\nonly through import of goods but also by its advertisement. The knowledge and\nawareness of the goods of a foreign trader and its trademark can be available at a\nplace where goods are not being marketed and consequently not being used.”\nIn Calvin Klein Inc v. International Apparel Syndicate, 1996 PTC 16, the Calcutta\nHigh Court observed that the goodwill and reputation of an international trademark\nare entitled to protection even though there was no user of the mark in India by the\nplaintiff. The Court held this to prevent the respondent from “cashing in” on the\ninternational reputation, whereby recognizing transborder reputation of a trademark\nnot filed or used in India.\nPage 2 of 4In Cadilla Health Care Ltd. v. Cadilla Pharmaceuticals Ltd., 2001 PTC 300 (SC),\nthe SC observed that “it must also be remembered that nowadays goods are widely\nadvertised in newspapers, periodicals, magazines and other media which is\navailable in the country. This results in a product acquiring a worldwide reputation.”\nIn Soliaon Ink v. Doctor and Co., 2002 (25) PTC 29, the Delhi High Court held that,\nif a mark has attained large sales figures in its country of origin, even\nadvertisements, without a single sale in India, would be sufficient to obtain an\ninjunction for passing off on the ground of transborder reputation.\nIn the case of Milmet Oftho Industries & Ors. v. Allergan Inc., 2004, the SC granted\ntrademark protection to a well-known foreign brand. The court restrained an Indian\ncompany from using the mark OCUFLOX. The judgment was given irrespective of\nthe fact that the mark was neither used nor registered in India. The court held that\nthe respondent was the first to enter the market and adopt the mark. It does not\nmatter that the respondent has not used the mark in India if they are the first to\nenter the world market.\nIn Enterprise Holdings, Inc. v. Enterprise Auto Rentals, 2014, the Hon’ble Delhi\nHigh Court has held that the concept of passing off had undergone changes with\nthe advent of technology modernization. The reputation of a business could\ntranscend boundaries by virtue of its advertisements in newspapers, media,\ncirculation, expatriate reputation and other relevant factors.\nIn Cadbury UK Limited & Anr v. Lotted India Corporation Ltd., 2014 (57) PTC 422\n(Delhi), the law relating to trans-border reputation has been further strengthened\nand has been taken to another level wherein the Court has not merely relied upon\nthe decisions of Milment Oftho and Whirlpool but has extended the principle of\ntrans-border reputation by observing that the existence of merchant on web pages\nwhich are of foreign origin and social media are sufficient to show the trans-border\nnature of reputation without having any activity in India at the relevant time, thereby\nshowcasing the global character of the trademark.\nREQUIREMENT OF GOODWILL\nIn December 2017, the SC passed a judgement in the case of Toyota Jidosha\nKabushiki Kaisha v. M/s Prius Auto Industries Limited, where it diluted its own\nfindings in the Whirlpool and Milmet Oftho judgements and denied relief in a\npassing-off action, while deciding the question on ‘Universality principle’ to\ndetermine transborder reputation. The SC, relying on the principle of Territoriality,\nheld that, showing transborder reputation in India is not sufficient. In order to\nenforce a famous, unregistered mark across international border, goodwill must be\nshown within the territory of India.\nConsidering India’s leading judicial precedents, the Prius case is considered as a\n‘bad law’ as the territoriality principle blocks the anticipated expansion of a foreign\ncompany to enter India. The SC did not analyze the earlier judicial pronouncements\nwhile adjudging this matter and furthermore did not assign any reasons while\ndeviating from the prior judgments.\nPage 3 of 4CONCLUSION\nDespite the Prius case, the Delhi High Court more recently in Singh and Singh LLP\nv. Singh + Singh Lawyers LLP, [2021] SCC Online Del 3059, was of the opinion\nthat in a world that is internet-driven, law firms such as that of the Plaintiff have a\nreputation that is not limited by geographical boundaries. In this case, the\nDefendant did not practice in India and had its office in Canada. The Plaintiff, on\nthe other hand, primarily practiced in India and also had a significant online\npresence. So, the issue was whether the Defendant’s mark caused confusion to\nthe Plaintiff’s foreign clientele. These cases typically speak to the mind of the Courts\nof India and the developing role of transborder reputation claims. Given the\ninternational nature of most brands, it could be argued that even without a\ntrademark registration, there is a significant chance of enforcement of one’s brand\nwithout a commercial presence or a registered trademark under India’s common\nlaw.\n-§-§-§-\nABOUT KOCHHAR & CO\nKochhar & Co is a leading full service commercial law firm with a national presence\nin India.

It received the President’s\nassent on 15th September 2023 to be known as the Mediation Act, 2023 (‘Mediation\nAct’). This article briefly explains the salient features of the Mediation Act and\noutlines the scope, applicability, key features, procedure, and possible challenges of\nthe Mediation Act.\nBACKGROUND\nWHAT IS MEDIATION?\nMediation is a structured process where a neutral person uses specialized\ncommunication and negotiation techniques to assist the parties in arriving at an\namicable settlement of their disputes. The concept of Mediation is an ancient and\ndeeply rooted practice in our country. It has been practised in the form of the\npanchayat system for centuries, in which certain respected elders of the village acted\nas mediators between the conflicting parties and helped to resolve their disputes.\nMEDIATION IN THE INDIAN LAWS\nSection 89(1) of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 allows courts to recommend\nvarious dispute resolution methods like arbitration, conciliation, judicial settlement, or\nmediation. Indian courts have been actively using this provision. As per the \"Survey\nof Dispute Resolution in India, 2023,\" conducted collaboratively by the Federation of\nIndian Corporate Lawyers (FICL) and the Centre for Trade and Investment Law\n(CTIL), Mediation/Conciliation has been rated as the second most preferred way to\n1 Ms. Kavita Sarin is a Partner and Mr. Vishal Bhardwaj is a Senior Associate in the dispute resolution and\narbitration team of the Firm’s Delhi office.\n1 | Pageresolve disputes in India. In India, there are mediation centres established\nthroughout the country. However, private mediation lacked a clear structure and legal\nrecognition, which made people hesitant to participate. To address these issues and\nmake mediation more effective, the Mediation Act has been introduced, aiming to\nprovide a solid legal framework and improve the overall mediation process. The\nMediation Act seeks to institutionalise and formalise the mediation process, which is\nlikely to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the same.\nSCOPE & APPLICABILITY\n❖ Scope\nThe Mediation Act extends the scope of mediation to civil and commercial disputes\nwhile providing an indicative list of disputes which are not suitable for mediation. The\ndisputes involving minors or individuals with intellectual disabilities, criminal offenses,\ntax-related issues, land acquisition issues, and certain regulatory matters are\nconsidered unfit for mediation under the Mediation Act.\n❖ Applicability\nThe Mediation Act applies to mediations conducted in India, including cases where\nall parties are based in India; where the mediation agreement specifies its\napplicability; or in international mediations involving at least one party from a country\nother than India. However, when one of the parties is the Central or State\nGovernment, it applies only to commercial disputes or to such disputes as may be\nnotified.\nIt is important to note that the Mediation Act does not cover mediations conducted\noutside India.\nKEY FEATURES OF THE MEDIATION ACT\n1. DEFINITION OF MEDIATION\nThe Mediation Act provides for a comprehensive definition of mediation which\nincludes pre-litigation mediation, online mediation, community mediation, and\nconciliation within the umbrella of 'mediation.'\nThis aligns with international practice, where the terms 'mediation' and\n'conciliation' are often used interchangeably, as previously recognized by the\nSupreme Court of India, and documented in the Singapore Convention.\nConsequently, the Mediation Act renders the conciliation procedure as provided\nin the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, insignificant.\n2 | PagePrelitigation mediation: The Mediation Act recognizes the mediation process\nwhere irrespective of any mediation agreement, the parties voluntarily\nundertake for settlement of dispute prior to filing of any case of civil or\ncommercial nature before the court.\nInternational mediation: Mediation undertaken between parties relating to\ncommercial dispute where at least one of the parties resides or has place of\nbusiness outside India.\nCommunity mediation: The Mediation Act provides for community mediation\nwhere mediation is undertaken to resolve disputes likely to affect the peace and\nharmony amongst residents of a locality. Community mediation is required to be\nconducted by a panel of three mediators.\nOnline mediation: Mediation undertaken electronically, through internet based\ncommunication tools. Online mediation can take place pursuant to written\nconsent of parties at any stage of mediation under this Mediation Act. The\nMediation Act clarifies that even if the parties agree to undertake online\nmediation, for the purpose of enforcement, challenge, and registration of the\nmediated settlement agreement, the same shall be deemed to have been\nundertaken within the territorial jurisdiction of the court of competent\njurisdiction.\n2. MEDIATION COUNCIL OF INDIA\nThe Meditation Council is yet to be set up by the central government. The\nMediation Act provides for establishment of a regulator i.e., the Mediation\nCouncil to register, recognize and regulate mediation institutions and mediators\nin India. The Meditation Council would also be tasked to promote international\nand domestic mediation in India, facilitate and conduct continuous training,\neducation, and certifications in mediation, and also maintain a depository of\nmediation settlement agreements made in India.\n3. INSTITUTION OR AUTHORITY FOR CONDUCTING MEDIATION\nMediation proceedings may be conducted by a Mediation Service Provider\nwhich includes:\na. a body or an organization which conducts of mediation in accordance with\nrules and regulations framed under the Mediation Act and is recognised by\nthe Mediation Council of India;\nb. an authority constituted under the Legal Services Mediation Act, 1987;\nc. a court annexed mediation centre; and\nd. any other body as notified by Central Government.\n3 | PageThe authorities constituted under the Legal Services Act, 1987, court annexed\nmediation centres and bodies notified by Central Government are deemed to\nbe mediation service providers recognised by the Mediation Council.\n4. MEDIATION AGREEMENT\nThe Mediation Act provides for mediation agreement to be ‘in writing’ to mean\neither (a) any document signed by the parties, or (b) an exchange of\ncommunications or letters including through electronic form, or (c) any\npleadings or any other proceedings in which existence of mediation agreement\nis alleged by one party and not denied by the other. Mediation agreement may\nbe in the form of a clause in an agreement or separate agreement.\n5. MEDIATOR UNDER THE MEDIATION ACT\nAny person, regardless of nationality, can be chosen as a mediator through a\nprocess agreed upon by the parties. However, when it comes to foreign\nmediators, there are specific qualifications, experience, and accreditations that\nneed to be met, as prescribed. The disputing parties are free to agree upon the\nname of the mediator and the procedure for their appointment. If there is no\nagreement, the parties can request for appointment of a mediator from the\npanel maintained by the Mediation Service Provider, taking into account their\npreferences and the mediator's suitability for resolving the dispute.\nThe proposed mediator must disclose in writing any circumstances, be it\npersonal, professional, financial, or otherwise, that could potentially create a\nconflict of interest or raise doubts about their independence or impartiality.\nAdditionally, a mediator appointed in this manner cannot simultaneously serve\nas an arbitrator or act as a counsel/representative for any party involved in an\narbitration or judicial proceeding that is the subject of the ongoing mediation.\nThey cannot be presented as a witness in any such proceeding.\n6. ROLE OF MEDIATOR:\nThe mediator's role is to assist the parties independently, neutrally, and\nimpartially, guided by principles of objectivity and fairness. The mediator can\nmeet with the parties separately or together as needed.\nImportantly, the mediator is not bound by the procedural rules of the Code of\nCivil Procedure, 1908, or the Indian Evidence Act, 1872. This flexibility allows\nfor a more tailored approach in reaching a mutually agreeable settlement,\nrespecting party autonomy in the process.\n4 | Page7. PLACE OF MEDIATION PROCEEDINGS:\nMediation proceedings must be typically conducted within the jurisdiction of the\ncompetent court or tribunal responsible for deciding the disputed subject matter.\nHowever, parties can agree to hold mediation at another location by mutual\nconsent. Additionally, parties have the option to conduct mediation online,\nprovided they formally agree to it in writing.\n8. COMMENCEMENT OF PROCEEDINGS:\nMediation officially begins when a party receives notice initiating mediation, as\nspecified in a mediation agreement. If there is no prior agreement, mediation\nstarts from the date of the mediator's appointment or consent to be appointed,\nwhichever comes first.\n9. TIME PERIOD FOR CONCLUDING MEDIATION:\nThe mediation process must be concluded within 120 days from the mediator's\nfirst appearance, with an option to extend it by up to 60 days if all parties agree.\nSimilar changes are proposed in the Commercial Courts Act, 2015, to align pre-\nlitigation mediation timelines.\n10. CONFIDENTIALITY:\nSection 22 of the Mediation Act categorically provides that the Mediator,\nMediation Service Provider as well as the parties to mediation proceedings are\nobligated to keep confidential several aspects, including statements, proposals,\ndocuments, and any other communication exchanged during the mediation.\nMoreover, recording mediation proceedings through audio or video is prohibited\nto ensure confidentiality.\nImportantly, the information discussed during mediation cannot be used as\nevidence in court, arbitration, or any legal proceedings. This extends the\nprotection under “without prejudice privilege” to parties to encourage them to\nengage in candid discussions towards an amicable settlement.\n11. MEDIATED SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT\nMediated Settlement Agreement is the understanding or agreement arrived at\nbetween the parties, recorded in writing the settlement of some or all disputes.\nThe key features of the Mediated Settlement Agreement are:\n5 | Pagea) The agreement must be written, signed by parties, and authenticated by the\nmediator.\nb) It is final and binding on the parties.\nc) Registration of the agreement is not mandatory. The Parties have an option to\nregister a Mediated Settlement Agreement (other than those arrived in a court\nor tribunal referred mediation or under the Legal Services Authorities Act,\n1987), with the authority under the Mediation Act or as may be specified,\nwithin 180 days (subject to extension) of receiving the authenticated copy of\nthe Agreement.\n12. ENFORCEMENT AND CHALLENGE TO MEDIATED SETTLEMENT\nAGREEMENT\nA Mediated Settlement Agreement can be enforced following the Code of Civil\nProcedure, 1908, like a court decree.\nA Mediated Settlement Agreement can be challenged within 90 days before a\ncompetent court on four grounds including fraud, corruption, impersonation,\nand if the dispute's subject matter was not eligible for mediation under the\nMediation Act. The parties can file an application to challenge the settlement\nagreement within 90 days from receiving a copy of the same, with the\npossibility of an extension of further period of 90 days, if the court believes that\nthere is a valid reason to do so. While the Mediation Act aims to limit the\ngrounds for challenge, there is a concern that errant parties might misuse these\nprovisions, undermining the purpose of the Mediation Act.\n13. NON-SETTLEMENT REPORT\nIf the mediation does not lead to a settlement within the time period stipulated\nunder the Mediation Act, the mediator is required to prepare a non-settlement\nreport without disclosing the cause of non-settlement and share signed copy\nwith the parties and, in case of institutional mediation, submit the same in\nwriting with the Mediation Service Provider.\n14. INTERIM ORDERS BY COURTS\nThe courts referring parties to mediation may pass interim orders to protect any\nparty's interests, if necessary. However, unlike section 9 of the Arbitration and\nConciliation Act, 1996, the Mediation Act does not specify the nature and extent\nof such power.\n6 | Page15. EXCLUSION OF PERIOD IN RESPECT OF WHICH A MEDIATION HAS\nBEEN UNDERTAKEN UNDER THE MEDIATION ACT\nIn computing the period of limitation fixed for any proceeding relating to\ndisputes in respect of which a mediation has been undertaken under the\nMediation Act, the period from the date of commencement of mediation under\nthe Mediation Act and up to submission of non-settlement report by the\nmediator or termination of mediation under the Mediation Act, shall be\nexcluded.\n16. FEE / EXPENSES FOR MEDIATION\nThe cost of mediation, other than community mediation would be such as may\nbe specified in rules and regulations framed under the Mediation Act. Unless\notherwise agreed by the parties, all costs of mediation, including the fees of the\nmediator and the charges of the Mediation Service Provider are required to be\nborne equally by the parties.\nCONCLUSION\nThe Mediation Act is a welcome move and an extremely significant milestone in the\nlegal landscape as it provides a comprehensive framework to streamline, structure\nand institutionalise the mediation process. In India, alternate dispute resolution\nsystem such as ‘mediation’ holds immense importance due to its high potential to\nease out the existing burden on the judiciary and offer a cost-effective and\nexpeditious dispute resolution mechanism while preserving relationships and\nempowering the parties with customized solutions.\n7 | Page"}

In July of last year, the Delhi High Court decided that the Patent Act\nsupersedes the Competition Act in matters of abuse of or anti-competitive practices\nin relation to patent rights. The courts of India were also called upon to decide on\nsubject matter patentability on appeal from a patent office rejection, and in another\ncase advised the office on the procedural requirement of giving reasons for every\nobjection. In an unusual situation, the courts were also required to settle an issue\nrelating to the confidentiality of trade secrets in a patent infringement case. Some\nkey decisions in 2023 follows,\nKEY CASES\nA SUBJECT MATTER IS PATENTABLE IF THERE IS A\nSYNERGISTIC COMBINATION OR A WORKING INTERRELATION\nWHICH PRODUCES A NEW AND IMPROVED RESULT.\nBiomoneta Research Pvt Ltd v. Controller General of Patents\nDate of Judgment:13/03/2023\nThis was an appeal filed against an order passed by the patent office rejecting a\npatent application of the Appellant for an “Air Decontamination Assembly”. The\npatent application was refused on the ground that it lacked inventive step as\nrequired under the Patents Act, 1970 (“Act”).\nIt was contended by the Appellant that the subject invention had several\ndistinguishing features when compared to prior arts cited by the patent office. For\ninstance, it was contended that the subject invention does not use air filters used\nby conventional air purifiers and that it uses low voltage instead of high voltage and\nthat there is no discharge between the plates as they are parallel to each other.\nThe Appellant also contended that the apparatus comprising the subject invention\nenhanced the microbicidal activity in air purifiers in an unpredictable manner, which\nhas in turn led to surprising effects not disclosed in the art. The Appellant further\nhighlighted the advantages of the subject invention and contended that since the\nsubject invention uses a low electric field, power consumption is reduced; and that\nthe subject invention has no maintenance issues.\nPage 1 of 4The Court upheld the Appellant’s contentions and directed the patent office to grant\na patent for the subject invention. It was held that a subject matter is patentable if\nthere is a synergistic combination or a working interrelation which produces a new\nand improved result. The Court relied on the EPO guidelines on combinations and\nheld that if the claims consist of a combination of features, it is incorrect to argue\nthat separate features taken by themselves are obvious and that therefore the\nwhole subject matter claimed is obvious. The Court also placed reliance on the fact\nthat the subject invention addressed various disadvantages in the prior art such as\nfrequent changing of filters, high power consumption, lesser maintenance costs,\netc.\nTHE CONFIDENTIALITY OF TRADE SECRETS IN A PATENT\nINFRINGEMENT DISPUTE MUST BE MAINTAINED\nPawan Kumar Goel vs Dr. Dhan Singh & Anr.\nDate of Judgment: 15/03/2023\nThis was a patent infringement suit whereby the plaintiff sought a permanent\ninjunction against the defendant for infringing the plaintiff’s process patent. It was\ncontended by the plaintiff that the defendant is using the plaintiff’s patented process\nto manufacture the product “Alpha Yohimbine/ Rauwolscine HCL, and that the\nplaintiff’s patented process is the only way to manufacture said product. The plaintiff\nrelied on Section 104(A)(1)(b) of the Act to contend that in a process patent\ninfringement action, where a defendant’s product is identical and is likely to be\nmade by the process under the process patent and where the same cannot be\ndetermined by reasonable efforts, it is the defendant’s duty to demonstrate that the\nprocess used to manufacture its product is different from the process patent.\nThe defendant contended that the subject product was manufactured using the\ndefendant’s process which is unique and proprietary, prior to the date of filing of the\nplaintiff’s process patent. The defendant further contended the suit was an attempt\nto extract their trade secrets. Citing Section 104A(2) of the Act, the Defendant\ncontended that in discharge of their burden under Section 104A(1)(b) of the Act,\nthat they cannot be forced to reveal their commercial secrets when such disclosure\nwould be unreasonable. The defendant thereby requested the formation of a\nconfidential club to inspect redacted documents disclosing their process.\nIn the interest of balancing the rights of both parties, the Court invoked its powers\nunder the Delhi High Court Rules 2018 and ordered the formation of a\nconfidentiality club to facilitate access to the defendant’s commercially sensitive\ndocuments.\nTHE PATENT ACT, 1970 PREVAILS OVER THE COMPETITION\nACT, 2002\nTelefonaktiebolaget LM Ericsson v. Competition Commission of India\nDate of Judgment: 13/07/2023\nThe Delhi High Court held that in case of an alleged abuse of dominance by a\npatentee when exercising its rights under a patent, the Act will prevail over the\nCompetition Act, 2002. The Court held that it was always the intention of the\nPage 2 of 4legislature for the Act to govern abuse of or anti-competitive practices in relation to\npatent rights, and that once the power of inquiry as regards anti-competitive\nbehavior is vested on the Controller of Patents, the Competition Commission of\nIndia (“CCI”) does not have powers inquire into such matters. It was further held\nthat since the Act is the special statute, it must prevail over the Competition Act on\nthe issue of exercise of rights by a patentee under the Act.\nCONDUCT OF THE PARTIES DURING LICENSE NEGOTIATIONS\nIS A KEY FACTOR WHILE ASSESSING WHETHER A POTENTIAL\nLICENSOR AND LICENSEE WERE A WILLING LICENSOR OR\nWILLING LICENSEE\nIntex Technologies (India) Ltd v. Telefonaktiebolaget L M Ericsson\nDate of Judgment: 29/03/2023\nThis was an appeal filed by Intex against an order of a single judge of the Delhi\nCourt upholding the validity and essential nature of Ericsson’s 8 Standard Essential\nPatents (“SEP”) and holding Intex liable for prima facie infringement of Ericsson’s\npatents.\nThe Court held that Intex had admitted in proceedings before the CCI that\nEricsson’s subject patents are essential and that the only way for Intex to comply\nwith ETSI/3GPP GSM standards in India was to obtain a license from Ericsson. The\nCourt also held that merely because Intex has filed a revocation petition against\nEricsson’s subject SEPs, it cannot be presumed that Intex has raised a credible\nchallenge against validity of said patents. It was held that the SEP regime\nincorporates mutual reciprocal obligations on both the SEP holder as well as the\nimplementer (Intex in this case), and that the conduct of the parties during license\nnegotiations is a key factor while assessing whether a potential licensor and\nlicensee were a willing licensor or willing licensee. The Court further held that Intex\nhas infringed Ericsson’s subject SEPs, and that the royalty sought by Ericsson is\non Fair, Reasonable, and Non-Discriminatory (FRAND) terms, and therefore\ndirected Intex to pay Ericsson the applicable royalty amount for past use of\nEricsson’s subject SEPs.\nDEFENDANT IN DISPUTE COULD NOT PROVE NON-\nINFRINGEMENT AS ALL ESSENTIAL FEATURES OF THE\nPATENT COULD BE MAPPED ON THE DEFENDANT’S PRODUCT\nStrix Ltd. V. Maharaj Appliances Limited\nDate of Judgment: 20/10/2023\nIn the present case, the plaintiff filed for a permanent injunction against the\ndefendant restraining them against infringement of their patent, and for payment of\ndamages. The defendant in turn filed a counterclaim challenging the validity of the\nplaintiff’s patent. The defendant also contended that the plaintiff’s patent was not\nworked in India.\nThe Court held that the plaintiff’s invention is novel and non-obvious over the prior\nart patents cited by the defendant. The Court observed that two of the prior art\nPage 3 of 4patents submitted by the defendant have a priority date which is subsequent to the\npriority date of the plaintiff’s patent application, and therefore the said prior art\npatents were held to not constitute valid prior art. The Court further distinguished\nthe third prior art patent submitted by the defendant from the plaintiff’s patent and\nheld that although both inventions achieve the same result, the same is achieved\nusing different mechanisms.\nThe Court further mapped all the essential features of the plaintiff’s patent onto\nthe features of the defendant’s product and held the defendant’s product to be\ninfringing the plaintiff’s patent. The Court directed the defendant to pay the plaintiff\ndamages of INR 50 Lakhs and actual costs of INR 31,44,925.\nEVERY ORDER OF THE CONTROLLER OF PATENTS REJECTING\nA PATENT APPLICATION SHALL PROVIDE REASONS AND DEAL\nSYSTEMATICALLY AND SEQUENTIALLY WITH EACH\nOBJECTION\nHuhtamaki Oyj and Anr. v. Controller of Patents\nDate of Judgment: 26/5/2023\nThis was an appeal filed against a non-speaking rejection order filed by the patent\noffice. The Court held that every order of the Controller of Patents rejecting an\napplication seeking grant of a patent, or accepting or rejecting any pre- or post\ngrant opposition to such applications, shall be reasoned and speaking and shall\ndeal systematically and sequentially with each objection that requires\nconsideration whether contained in the First Examination Report or the hearing\nnotice or in any pre- or post-grant opposition, and provide reasons as to why the\nobjection is sustained or rejected.\nCONTACT DETAILS\nLynn Lazaro Arun Babu\nResident Partner (Toronto) Partner (Bangalore)\nlynn.lazaro@bgl.kochhar.com arun.babu@bgl.kochhar.com\nPage 4 of 4"}
{"Title": "Handbook on Combating Gender Stereotypes – the Supreme Court of India – a POV", "Publication_Date": "28 August 2023", "URL": "https://kochhar.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Kochhar-Co.-Bangalore.-Article-by-Debjani-Aich-Handbook-on-Combating-Gender-Stereotypes-the-Supreme-Court-of-India-a-POV-Aug-2023.pdf", "Content": "Handbook on\nCombating Gender Stereotypes - the\nSupreme Court of India - a POV\nBy Debjani Aich August 2023\nA day after India’s Independence Day on August 15th, 2023, the Hon’ble Supreme\nCourt of India released its Handbook on Combating Gender Stereotypes. I read\nthe Handbook late last night and this morning, intermittently laughing aloud and\ncheering and shaking my head in disbelief at some of the cases cited, a few of\nwhich I had read in law school and others that I may have forgotten but which\ncame up in the Handbook.\nQuoting from the foreword by Chief Justice Chandrachud, the Handbook aims at\nassisting judges and the legal community in “identifying, understanding and\ncombating stereotypes about women. It contains a glossary of gender-unjust\nterms and suggests alternative words or phrases which may be used while\ndrafting pleadings as well as orders and judgments. The Handbook identifies\ncommon stereotypes about women, many of which have been utilised by courts in\nthe past and demonstrates why they are inaccurate and how they may distort the\napplication of the law. The intention is not to criticise or cast doubt on past\njudgements but merely to show how stereotypes may unwittingly be employed.\nFinally, it encapsulates the current doctrine on key legal issues which may be\nrelevant while adjudicating certain cases, particularly those concerning sexual\nviolence.”\nOne of the strongest points I speak about in my POSH Act trainings for the\nInternal Committee members is to avoid stereotyping and bias. To see the\nHandbook deal head-on with these aspects gives me such joy – each aspect of\nthe guidelines will well serve employers as well to work on DEI measures. A few\nkey takeaways from the Handbook which I feel are important from an employer-\nemployee relationship are:\n➢ Incorrect stereotypes promoting language, including from a transgender\nindividual perspective.\n➢ Stereotypes based on the so-called “inherent characteristics” of women – a\nstereotype of women being overly emotional, illogical, and incapable of taking\ndecisions, whereas reality is cited as “A person’s gender does not determine\nPage 1 of 2or influence their capacity for rational thought.”\n➢ From a maternity law perspective, a stereotype that “All women want to have\nchildren” – the Handbook mentions that “All women do not want to have\nchildren. Deciding to become a parent is an individual choice that every person\ntakes based on a variety of circumstances”. Hiring folks and colleagues need\nto be aware of this, with no questions raised on a female candidate's marital\nstatus or whether she has/plans on having a child/children.\n➢ Stereotypes based on gender roles - even where male and female employees\nare of the same designation, a female employee may be tasked with\nadministrative duties such as organising office-events or buying stationery,\nwhile male employees are exempted from such tasks. While the Equal\nRemuneration Act requires an employer to not discriminate between male and\nfemale employees while recruiting for the same type of work or in employment\nconditions (which aspects the Code of Wages has further made gender\nneutral), gender-based perception and discrimination issues continue at the\nIndian workplace and a call-out like this is necessary.\n➢ Stereotypes concerning sex and sexual violence - From a POSH Act\nperspective, specific reference is made to the 1997 Supreme Court of India\nVishaka Guidelines, the benchmark for India’s current law on the prevention of\nsexual harassment at the workplace. A few examples stated in terms of reality\nis that “Rape and sexual violence have long been used as a tool of social\ncontrol. Dominant caste men have historically used sexual violence as a tool to\nreinforce and maintain caste hierarchies.” Also, “A woman who consents to\nsexual activity with one man does not consent to sexual activity with all\nmen.12 Similarly, a woman who consents to sexual activity with a man at a\nparticular instance does not ipso facto consent to sexual activity with that\nsame man at all other instances. A woman’s character or morals are unrelated\nto the number of sexual partners she has had.” These are aspects I\ncontinuously reiterate in the POSH trainings – past history of a complainant (or\nof a respondent, for that matter) is not a matter of judgement by the employer's\nInternal Committee.\nI hold this Handbook as one of the most relevant legal guidelines issued in India in\nrelation to DEI measures historically. I’m happy to answer any questions you may\nhave on these issues.\n-§-\nPage 2 of 2"}

The state’s avant-\ngarde vision, planning and effective execution of subsequent IT & ITES Policies of 2003 and 2009\nhave led to a strong IT base and have exhibited consistent growth figures for IT exports and\ninvestments. Due to effective changes in the IT & ITES Policy, 2015 (“2015 Policy”), the IT\necosystem in Maharashtra has evolved swiftly to keep up with global pace, making it one of the\nbest technology investment destinations, not only in India but in Asia.\nThe state’s IT policies have continually evolved in consonance with the global trends and demands.\nIn that vein, the Information Technology and Information Technology Enabled Services Policy of\nMaharashtra, 2023 (“2023 Policy”) was introduced by the Industries, Energy and Labour\nDepartment of the Government of Maharashtra vide its Resolution No. ITP-2021/CR-170/Ind-2\ndated June 27, 2023. The 2023 Policy shall be valid for a period of 5 years or until such time any\nnew or revised policy is announced by the State Government.\nAmbitions and goals of the 2023 Policy:\n Innovative, equitable, inclusive and\n Attract INR 950 billion new investments\nsustainable tech development\n Achieve INR 10,000 billion through IT &\n Global tech destination & innovation hub\nITES exports\n Create 3.50 million jobs and increase skill\n Preferred investment & innovation spot\ndevelopment\n Promoting IP creation, innovation &  Technology ambassador in the country\nindigenous tech through improved governance\n Developing & nurturing a highly skilled\n Accelerating Maharashtra's tech journey\ntalent pool\nIn order to meet such goals, the 2023 Policy has transfused a radiance of joy by introducing some\nnew incentives and exemptions. The following are the primary characteristics of the 2023 Policy:\n MAHITI PORTAL\nThe MAHITI portal will be a unified and integrated single window platform for time bound\nclearances serving numerous objectives such as (i) online applications for letter of intent / de-\nnovo letter of intent; (ii) online registration of IT / ITES units / parks, data centers; (iii) online\napplication for incentives and exemptions; (iv) daily updates and information on IT & ITES; (iv)\ninteractive incentive calculator, etc. The MAHITI portal would enable B2B functionality by creating\na channel that allows various IT & ITES businesses to list their units and services for connecting\nand interacting with domestic and international customers.\n1 STAMP DUTY EXEMPTION\nThe 2023 Policy divides exemption eligible locations into two broad categories:\n• Zone I Area: This area includes Municipal Corporations in Mumbai Metropolitan Region and\nPune Metropolitan Region; and\n• Zone II Area: This area includes areas other than those in Zone I and No Industry Districts,\nAspirational Districts and Naxalite affected areas.\nType of Document Exemption Percentage and Eligibility\na) 100% on new units in public / private IT\nparks and expansion of existing units in\nHypothecation, pawn, pledge, deposit of title areas other than Zone I;\ndeeds, conveyance, charge on mortgage b) 75% on new units in public IT parks and\nproperty, lease, mortgage deed and security bond expansion of existing units in areas\non mortgage deed. other than Zone I;\nc) 50% on new units in private IT parks\nlocated in Zone I.\n100% on new units and expansion of\nAll the documents mentioned above and public\nexisting units in IT parks for SEZ, STPI\nassignment of lease.\nregistered units.\nMerger, demerger, reconstruction of registered IT\n75% on new units and expansion of\n& ITES units, leave and license agreement and\nexisting units.\npublic assignment of lease.\nThe exemptions available under the 2023 Policy can be claimed depending on the eligibility and\nthe conditions as laid down therein.\nIn case of data centers, 100% stamp duty exemption can be claimed for purchasing land / premises\nrequired for setting up a new data centre and/or for its expansion as well as hypothecation, pawn,\npledge, deposit of title deeds, conveyance, lease, assignment of lease, leave and license\nagreement, merger, de-merger and reconstruction.\n BOOST FOR DATA CENTERS\nThe 2015 policy only provided incentives to data centres with minimum 10,000 square feet white\n/ raised space and 750 KVA power, within 2 years of operation and designed for Tier 2 and above\nlevel certification by an independent agency. No such restrictions have been laid down under the\n2023 Policy.\n2As per the 2015 Policy, electricity duty was exempt only for 10 years in some areas and 15 years\nin other areas. However, as per the 2023 policy, the electricity duty is permanently exempted for\nnew and existing data centers registered with the Directorate of Industries. Electricity is a major\nexpenditure component of a data centre and hence this will help in reducing the operational costs.\nThe 2015 Policy provided power tariff subsidy for 3 years at INR 1 per unit. However, subsidy at\nINR 1 per unit for 5 years for new data centre units located in areas other than Zone I has been\nprovided under the 2023 Policy.\nSome of the other key incentives exclusive to data centers are as under:\n Data centres can avail power through open access. This will enable data centres to buy\nrelatively cheaper power directly from the power producers.\n Data centers can also avail renewable energy under open access system after paying cost\ncomponent to DISCOMs as per existing norms. Data centers willing to establish captive\npower farms (wind / solar) will be facilitated by the State Government in line with the\nprevailing policy of Energy Department.\n Data centres shall be exempted from the statutory power cuts and will be given continuous\npower supply i.e. 24x7x365.\n 100% stamp duty exemption for purchasing land / premises required for setting up new\ndata centers and for further expansion.\n Dial before dig policy to help data centres manage down time. The service will be designed\nto protect data centres’ network of underground lines and cables and ensure the safety of\nthose working around this infrastructure.\n Data centres shall be given infrastructure status on a par with sectors such as railways,\nroadways and power to enable the industry to avail benefits such as long-term credit from\nlenders at easier terms and also industry status to avail benefits of tariffs, concessions and\ninitiatives related to various laws for ease of doing business.\n Data centres located in any Industrial Area Development Authority such as MIDC, will be\nprovided 24x7 uninterrupted water supply, both inside and outside the data center parks.\n Data centers will be permitted to avail additional FSI as per prevailing Development Control\nRegulations (“DCR”). Basement parking, storage and space used for diesel generator sets\ninstallation will not be considered as part of FSI.\n There will be relaxed restrictions on building data centers. DCRs will be suitably amended\non parameters such as parking norms, height of floors, FSI, etc.\n Infrastructure support like road, power, connectivity, water, etc. will be provided by MIDC.\nThe State Government will provide financial assistance required for laying transmission lines\nand sub-station related infrastructure to data center parks to be setup by MIDC and the\nState Government will earmark land parcels in MIDC areas to be developed as dedicated\ndata centre parks.\n3 For promoting use of renewable energy within data centres, the developer / operator shall\nbe eligible for getting licenses for green power energy distribution and consumption within\ndata centre parks.\n Property tax shall be levied at par with residential rates as applicable in the relevant\njurisdictions.\n INTEGRATED INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY TOWNSHIP\nThe minimum land criteria for establishing an Integrated Information Technology Township\n(“IITT”) has been reduced from 25 Acres of contiguous land to 10 Acres of contiguous land with\nstaggered proportion of usage component under the 2023 Policy. The 2023 Policy allows 50% for\nIT & ITES use and 50% for usage without any restriction.\nMIDC will be declared as the special planning authority throughout Maharashtra excluding areas\nbelonging to CIDCO. The project completion period for IITTs having aggregate land area of 10 to\n25 Acres shall be 7½ years whereas for IITTs having aggregate land area more than 25 Acres shall\nbe 10 years.\nIITTs will be permitted in any zone across Maharashtra. The developer may undertake project\nimplementation with or without zone conversion of the proposed area. However, FSI norms will\ncontinue to remain in terms of the prevailing classification as per applicable DCR norms viz. for\nprojects proposed in no development zone, green zone, special zone, etc.\n THRUST FOR AVGC & EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES\nThe 2023 Policy acknowledges that Animation, Visual Effects, Gaming & Comics (“AVGC”) is a\nsunrise sector having enormous potential for wealth creation and employment generation.\nMumbai is the entertainment capital of India and it is home to some of the largest Hollywood and\nBollywood VFX studios. The 2023 Policy focuses on bridging the demand-supply gap by attracting\nglobal companies in this sector thereby capturing a sizable share of outsourced AVGC work and\nfacilitating the ecosystem development. The 2023 Policy envisages to promote indigenous digital\ncontent by establishing a dedicated task force and center of excellence under Maharashtra hub.\nIn addition to the common incentives, significant interventions are proposed for AVGC industry\nsuch as customized capital assistance, market development assistance, skill development\nassistance, specialized infrastructure, production studios, digital art centers, exhibition galleries,\netc. and a dedicated IT & ITES promotion fund.\nThe 2023 Policy aims to create a blueprint for growth of emerging technologies such as Artificial\nIntelligence, 3D Printing, Internet of Things, Robotics, Cloud Computing, Immersive Technology,\nNanotechnology, etc. which shall be given fiscal and non-fiscal support in terms of the 2023 Policy.\n4 INCENTIVES FOR DEVELOPMENT\nAdditional FSI\nMaximum Permissible FSI Maximum Permissible FSI\nMinimum Road Width\n(Greater Mumbai Region) (Rest of Maharashtra)\n12 metres Up to 3 Up to 3\n18 metres Up to 4 Up to 3.50\n27 metres Up to 5 Up to 4\nAdditional FSI limit shall be applicable as above or as per the prevailing DCR norms, whichever is\nhigher. However, in case of no development zone, agricultural zone or any other special zone as\ndeclared by Urban Development Department, the prevailing DCR rate shall be applicable.\nPremium to be paid for Additional FSI\nArea Premium\nVidharbha, Marathwada, Dhule, Nandurbar,\nNo premium.\nRatnagiri and Sindhudurg.\nAreas other than those mentioned above\nincluding Municipal Corporation of Greater\nMumbai. 50% of the prevailing premium rate.\nArea declared as central business district by\nspecial planning authority.\nPermissible limits for mixed use development\nLand Use\nArea Allied / Support Applicability\nIT & ITES Units\nServices\nZone I 60% 40% a) IT parks including 2%\nbuilt-up area for\nincubation centers.\nb) Standalone buildings /\nAreas excluding Zone I 50% 50%\ngroup of buildings in IT\nparks with a minimum\nbuilt-up area of 20,000\nsquare feet.\n5Penalty for use of built-up area for non-IT & ITES use\nOn utilisation of the built-up area in a private IT park / data center or an existing IT park / data\ncenter (having benefited from additional FSI) for non-ITES / commercial activities / any other\nactivity not permitted under the 2023 Policy, a per day penalty of 0.30% of the prevailing ready\nreckoner value of the built-up area used for non-IT & ITES shall be levied. The penalty can be\nrecovered from the moment the occupancy certificate / building completion certificate was issued\nto the IT park / data center until such date till the non-compliance continues. In contrast to the\n2015 Policy, the 2023 Policy provides that the penalty must be levied on the end user / owner of\nthe unit. Moreover, the developer of the IT park / data center will not be allowed to sell / lease\nthe built-up area reserved for IT & ITES / data center activity to non-IT & ITES / non-data center\nuser, in any case.\n DE-NOVO LOI\nIT parks with incomplete construction or IT parks where the letter of intent (“LOI”) has expired\ndue to various exigent reasons, may apply for a ‘De-novo Letter of Intent’ for the IT park in terms\nof the following criteria:\nIT parks with complete construction but are unregistered:\nPrivate IT parks that have been operational for more than the stipulated period and have\ncompleted construction, but the LOI has expired, will be issued a de-novo LOI for 3 years without\ncharging any differential premium. To be eligible, the developer must have secured an occupancy\ncertificate / building completion certificate from the concerned planning authority.\nThis provision will apply to IT parks that have not yet applied for a de-novo LOI as of the effective\ndate of the 2015 Policy. However, at least 50% of the built-up area should have been occupied by\nIT / ITES units during this time period.\nIT parks with incomplete construction:\nPrivate IT parks that are still under construction and will not get completed within the stipulated\ntimelines for any reason whatsoever, will be eligible to obtain a de-novo LOI by paying a 30%\ndifferential premium. This premium will be calculated using the incremental ready reckoner rates\nfor IT parks during the applicable period.\nThe de-novo LOI will be granted based on the merits of each individual proposal and will initially\nbe valid for a period of 3 years. If the construction of the IT park is not completed despite the\nextension, then further extension may be granted by the Industries Department at its discretion.\n6 CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE FUND\nThe State Government will establish a separate ‘Critical Infrastructure Fund for IT & ITES Industries’\nfrom the premium paid for availing additional FSI by the developers of private IT parks. This fund\nshall be utilized for important infrastructure needs of IT parks or clusters of IT & ITES units such\nas roads, drainage, power or any other infrastructural needs.\nEach planning authority shall deposit the premium they collect from developers of the private IT\nparks for availing additional FSI in this fund. 50% of the total premium collected by the planning\nauthorities shall be deposited in the fund at source. The matching contribution from the State\nGovernment will also be deposited in this fund.\nDisclaimer: This is for information purpose only and is not intended to be an advertisement or solicitation.

{"Title": null, "Publication_Date": "28 August 2023", "URL": "https://kochhar.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Kochhar-Co.-Technology-Law-Advisory-%E2%80%93-Digital-Personal-Data-Protection-Act-2023-.pdf", "Content": "Technology Law Advisory – Digital\nPersonal Data Protection Act, 2023\nINTRODUCTION\nDuring the week of August 7, 2023, the Indian Parliament passed the Digital Personal Data\nProtection Act (“Act”) thereby bringing to a close a 5 year process to introduce a data privacy law\nfor India. The Act was assented to by the President of India and will come into force once notified\nby the Government. It is now a foregone conclusion that this Act will be the data privacy law of\nIndia in the days to come.\nThe Act follows on the lines of the previous version – a much simpler version that departs\nsubstantially from the GDPR model of privacy laws that is commonplace today. However, it\ncontains significant changes apart from dealing with several of the concerns relating to the\nprevious draft.\nDEFINITIONS\nThe Act uses similar nomenclature as in previous versions. A data subject is referred to as a data\nprincipal and a data controller is referred to as a data fiduciary. There is no concept of sensitive\npersonal data. The Data Protection Authority is referred to as the Data Protection Board of India\n(“DPBI”).\nAPPLICABILITY\nThe law applies only to personal data that is maintained in digital form. The law will apply to\nprocessing of personal data outside India if such processing is “in connection with any activity\nrelated to offering goods or services to data principals within the territory of India”.\nGROUNDS FOR COLLECTION AND PROCESSING\nConsent continues to be the main ground for processing of personal data. It must be “freely\ngiven”, “’specific”, “informed”, “unconditional”, and an “unambiguous indication of consent”\nthrough a “clear affirmative action”. It seems clear that explicit consent would be required.\nConsent can also be withdrawn, the consequences of which would be borne by the data principal.\nOne can also use a consent manager to manage the consent process.\nThe Act also includes obvious grounds for processing personal data without consent, for\n‘legitimate uses’ such as compliance with laws and court orders, actions dealing with medical\nemergencies and epidemics and law & order situations. Further, processing of personal data for\ncertain employment purposes or for protecting an employer from liability, constitutes legitimate\nuse under the Act, and consent is not required for such processing.\nPage 1 of 7Another key ground which qualifies as a legitimate use, is where the data principal voluntarily\nprovides her personal data to the data fiduciary for a specified purpose and where the data\nprincipal has not indicated that she does not give her consent for use of her personal data. This\nappears to deal with automatic collection of personal data – the illustration covers a situation\nwhere a person visits a shop and hands over her personal information.\nLEGITIMATE INTEREST\nAs in the previous versions, there is no clear “legitimate interest” ground. The situations of\nlegitimate uses are borne of necessity and don’t cover as much ground as the concept of\nlegitimate interest under the GDPR. Except for the limited grounds that qualify as ‘legitimate use’,\nconsent seems to be the only route to processing personal data.\nNOTICE\nThe notice to be given to the data principal covers two key aspects – the personal data to be\nprocessed and the purposes of processing. In addition, the data principal should be informed of\nher right to withdraw consent and the grievance redressal procedure available to her. It appears\nthat the notice must be made accessible in English and in all 22 languages specified in the Eighth\nSchedule of the Constitution.\nAPPLICABILITY TO CHILDREN\nThe law keeps the threshold for children at 18 years. This will be seen as a disappointment for the\nonline world as global standards tend to be closer to 16 years. Verifiable parental consent is\nrequired for collection of personal data of children. Further, the Act prohibits processing that may\nhave a detrimental effect on the well-being of the child as well as behavioral monitoring or\ntargeted advertising to children. However, the Government has the power to exempt some of\nthese restrictions through a notification.\nRIGHTS AND DUTIES OF DATA PRINCIPALS\nThere are several rights of data principals. These include the right to know what personal data is\nbeing processed and the right to have inaccurate personal data corrected or personal data to be\nupdated. A data principal can also ask for personal data to be deleted unless it is still required for\nthe specified purpose for which it was collected. However, these rights exist only when personal\ndata is provided voluntarily or with consent. Interestingly, the Act includes duties of data\nprincipals. This pertains essentially to a duty not to provide false information and not to lodge\nfrivolous or false grievances.\nSTORAGE OF PERSONAL DATA\nThe law requires the data fiduciary to ensure completeness, accuracy, and consistency of\npersonal data where it is used to make a decision that affects a data principal or where it is\ndisclosed to another data fiduciary. This may have implications for the use of AI on personal data.\nData fiduciaries must also use reasonable security measures to prevent data breaches. A data\nPage 2 of 7fiduciary must delete personal data when the specified purpose for which it was collected has\nbeen served unless such personal data is required to be retained for compliance with any law.\nPERSONAL DATA BREACH\nThe law defines a ‘personal data breach’ to mean any unauthorized processing or accidental\ndisclosure, use, alteration, or destruction of personal data, that compromises its confidentiality,\nintegrity, or availability. In case of a personal data breach, the data fiduciary or data principal must\ninform both the DPBI as well as the affected data principal, in a manner prescribed by the\ngovernment. The broad definition of a personal data breach would cover even small instances of\ndata breaches and situations of vulnerability for which notification to the DPBI and data principals\nseems quite onerous.\nSIGNIFICANT DATA FIDUCIARY\nThe law retains the concept of a Significant Data Fiduciary (“SDF”). This is a data fiduciary that\nfulfills the criteria set forth by the government. In determining who would be a SDF, the\ngovernment will consider factors such as volume of data processed by the data fiduciary and risk\nto rights of the data principal. Interestingly, such factors also include “potential impact on the\nintegrity and sovereignty of India” and “risk to electoral democracy”. An SDF’s is required to\nappoint a Data Protection Officer, who must report to the Board of the company. Further, it must\nappoint an independent data auditor to audit compliance with the privacy law. They also have to\nconduct privacy impact assessments.\nDATA PROTECTION OFFICER\nOnly an SDF is required to appoint a Data Protection Officer. However, every data fiduciary must\nappoint a person to act as the point of contact for data principals who wish to raise any issues.\nThe contact details of the Data Protection Officer and the grievance officer need to be published.\nDATA PROCESSORS\nThe law requires data fiduciaries to execute a data processing agreement with a data processor.\nData fiduciaries are responsible for compliance of the law by data processors.\nDATA LOCALIZATION AND DATA TRANSFERS\nThe law includes a right on the government to notify a “negative list” of countries to whom\npersonal data cannot be transferred. Other than this list and in the absence of a notification being\nissued, one can transfer personal data to any country. There is no requirement for adequacy in\nthe statute or for retaining copies of the personal data in India. Other means of transferring\npersonal data to blacklisted countries such as standard contractual clauses, explicit consent or\ninter-group transfers are not covered in the Act. The Act does however permit sectoral data\nlocalization regulations such as the one that exists in the payments sector.\nPage 3 of 7EXEMPTION TO GOVERNMENT\nThe Act grants the power to the government to exempt itself and its agencies from most\nrequirements of the Act. The grounds mentioned, such as sovereignty and integrity of India,\nsecurity of state, etc., are taken from the Constitution of India and are also cited by the Supreme\nCourt of India as grounds on which privacy rights can be restricted. These grounds are however\nquite broad, and proportionality and reasonableness are not essential ingredients. These are also\ngrounds of legitimate use for which processing of personal data by the government does not\nrequire consent. Unfortunately, the law has extended a direct exemption to the judiciary to bodies\nthat have regulatory or supervisory functions. No government notification is required for this\nexemption to apply; these organizations are directly exempted under the law.\nEXEMPTION TO OTHERS, START UPS\nThe Government has the power to exempt certain data fiduciaries including start ups from some\nprovisions of the law (right to access, requirement to give notice, limitation on retention). It\nappears the government will implement some kind of regulatory standbox for start ups to make it\neasier for them to comply with the new law.\nCONTENT BLOCKING\nThe law grants powers to the government to block public access to any information generated,\nreceived, stored, or hosted in any computer resource used for providing services within India, in\nthe ‘interests of the general public’, upon receiving a reference from the DPBI. While the\ngovernment has similar powers under the Information Technology Act, 2000, such powers do not\nrelate directly to the protection of personal information.\nPENALTIES\nThe law prescribes penalties for non-compliance. There is a schedule which mentions a\nmaximum penalty for specific violations. For example, failure to take reasonable security\nsafeguards to prevent personal data breach would involve a penalty of up to Rs. 2.5 billion\n(approx. USD 30 million). This is the maximum penalty prescribed. Interestingly, there is no\nprovision for awarding compensation to affected data subjects.\nANALYSIS\nApproach. When the previous draft was released in 2022, we said that the government’s\napproach was appropriate for a country like India. India does not have a long history of\ncompliance with privacy standards and also has a huge unorganized and SME sector. At the\nsame time, most businesses will have stored some personal data, especially payment\ninformation, in digital form. This means that almost all of Indian industry will be covered by the\nlaw. In this context, a simpler legislation with fewer obligations will be a good start.\nNotice. The requirement to make the notice accessible in English and in 22 other languages,\nwould be too onerous for most data fiduciaries and may not serve its purpose, since most digital\nPage 4 of 7services and related documentation are anyway made available exclusively in English. Perhaps\nthere will be a clarification that the data fiduciary can provide the notice in English and the most\nappropriate language among the list of 22 languages.\nLegitimate Interest. The government has stuck to its stand from the beginning that legitimate\ninterest, as it is understood in the EU, will not be a part of the law. There are legitimate uses such\nas statutory necessity, but these are standard and fairly narrow grounds.\nConsent. The main ground for processing personal data is consent. The language defining\nconsent is identical to the GDPR leading us to wonder whether India will require consent based\non the same standards as in the EU. The addition of the word “unconditional” for collection of all\npersonal information sets a potentially higher standard for obtaining consent than under GDPR.\nVoluntary provision of personal data. The provision which allows processing of personal data\nshared “voluntarily”, is poorly drafted as a data fiduciary can list various specified purposes and\nthe data principal will then “voluntarily” provide her personal data. Perhaps the government meant\nto refer to a situation where the personal data is provided on the initiative of the data principal. It\nremains to be seen whether this provision would be abused. The reference to “specified purpose”\nis also confusing in a situation where personal data is given automatically as part of a transaction\nand no notice of specified purpose is given.\nPurpose Limitation. The language on purpose limitation is not well defined. It is not entirely clear\nthat there is a prohibition on a data fiduciary providing a laundry list of “specified purposes”. It can\nbe interpreted that as long as the personal data is processed for the specified purpose mentioned\nin the notice, it is permitted. Legitimacy of purpose does not appear to be a part of the law.\nExclusion to Government. The Act contains provisions that exclude the government directly and\nindirectly. While granting power to the government to exclude some of its instrumentalities is\njustified, the lack of standards to do so, such as reasonableness and proportionality, is\nunfortunate. This may however be supplied by the judiciary as the jurisprudence is already\ndeveloped through past judgments. However, the most unfortunate provision is where the\nexception granted to the judiciary has been expanded to include bodies that have regulatory or\nsupervisory powers. This would directly exclude vast sections of the government.\nForeign Personal Data. The law excludes most provisions from applicability to foreign personal\ndata that is processed in India. This is somewhat counterproductive as one of the reasons for\nhaving a privacy law is to assure the world that it is safe to send personal information to India. It\nalso means that the legislation will fail to obtain an adequacy ruling from the EU. In any case, due\nto not having independent oversight over government surveillance, Indian law does not fully\ncomply with Schrems II. The extraordinary powers and exemptions to the government would also\nmake that seemingly impossible.\nData Breach Notification. The insistence on notification of data breach or vulnerability in every\ncase, not just to the DPBI but to concerned data principals goes against global standards. This is\none of those instances where the law is stricter than the GDPR. Added to that is the existing and\nPage 5 of 7unfeasible 6 hour breach notification requirement to the CERT-In, the deadline of which appears\nto be observed mostly in the breach.\nPowers of DPBI. The most disappointing aspect of the Act is the lack of powers given to the\nDPBI. All powers of delegated legislation rest with the government. The DPBI is purely an\nadjudication body. Personal data is so ubiquitous that it is very hard to pass regulation while\nunderstanding all its implications. One needs a tech savvy and nimble DPBI who can issue\nclarifications, discuss with stakeholders, issue consultation and recommendation papers and\nguidance notes. None of these powers have been provided to the DPBI. The nature of personal\ninformation and the technology world dictates that privacy law be as dynamic as possible. This is\nnot likely to happen in the current scheme of things.\nPrivacy v. Right to Information. Finally, the law amends the Right to Information Act. Whereas\npreviously, a senior government officer would determine whether public interest outweighed the\nneed to protect personal information, the new legal position would be that personal information\ncan never be disclosed as part of a right to information request.\nThe Way Forward\nThe law does not provide for a gestation period for compliance. The Government has announced\nthat it would implement the law within 10 months. We assume that the government will bring the\nlaw into force in stages as it has done for some other legislations. It would however be\nappropriate for the government to notify immediately when exactly the substantive provisions will\ncome into force so that the industry can prepare for it with a clear deadline in mind.\nIn the days to come, we will be rolling out our own program to train clients and prepare them for\ncompliance with the new law.

The courts also laid down the law in relation to the\nuse of generative artificial intelligence to create deepfakes, the shield of fair use of\ncelebrity names and images and the usage of dynamic injunctions in contemporary\ncopyright law. Some key events include,\nKEY CASES\n“LITERARY WORK” CANNOT INCLUDE A MOBILE APP; GUI IS\nNOT CONSIDERED “WORK” UNDER THE COPYRIGHT ACT.\nHULM Entertainment Pvt. Ltd. v. Fantasy Sports MYFAB11 Pvt. Ltd\nDate of Judgment:17/10/2023\nA suit was filed by Plaintiffs against the Defendant over their Fantasy Sports app\nthat further amalgamated features of stock market.\nThe High Court held that the competitor’s app could not be proved to be infringing\non the Plaintiff’s copyright, which as for a concept note registered as a literary work;\nan adaptation as in section 2(a)(ii)-(iii) could not include a mobile app. The High\nCourt also held that a Graphic User Interface (GUI) is not a ‘work’ under the\nCopyright Act and thus there is no copyright in a GUI per se under sections 13 &\n16; relying on the test in the US judgement of Apple Tech v. Microsoft.\nThe High Court further went into detail regarding the Doctrine of Merger, that\nwhen an idea can only be expressed in a limited number of ways, there is no\ncopyright as that would confer a monopoly on the idea.\nONLY UNIQUE COMMUNICATION WOULD CONSTITUTE AN\nEXPRESSION PROTECTABLE UNDER COPYRIGHT\nHumans of Bombay Stories Pvt. Ltd. v. POI Social Media Pvt. Ltd.\nDate of Judgment: 11/10/2023\nA copyright infringement suit filed by Humans of Bombay against People of India\nfor alleged copyright violation in their content imitating the Plaintiff’s content.\nThe court ruled that there could be no monopoly over a storytelling platform, but\neach one’s unique way of communicating those stories, including images, literary\nPage 1 of 3content and manner could constitute an expression protectable under copyright.\nMoreover, with regards to subject submitted content, if commissioned, copyright\nwould be with the platform itself but otherwise there could be no claim on these.\nDISTRIBUTION OF TV SERIALS ON WEBSITES AMOUNT TO\nPIRACY AND COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT\nStar India Pvt. Ltd. v. Yodesiserial.su & Ors.\nDate of Judgment:10/04/2023\nA suit was filed by Plaintiffs, being producers of TV serials, against defendants\nrunning websites distributing said serials under Plaintiff’s copyright – i.e., piracy.\nThe Court passed a permanent injunction restraining these websites as well as all\nothers acting on their behalf from; communicating, hosting, streaming, or making\navailable for viewing and downloading without authorization, on websites/social\nmedia/any other platform through the internet or in any other way the Plaintiff’s\ncopyrighted content.\nDYNAMIC INJUNCTION RULING AGAINST ALL MIRROR\nWEBSITES\nStar India Pvt. Ltd. & Anr. v. JioLive.tv & ors.\nDate of Judgment: 27/09/2023\nA request for dynamic injunction against potential violators of Plaintiff’s copyright to\nbroadcast the ICC Men’s World Cup was filed against piracy websites that are\nhighly likely to pop up and damage the Plaintiff’s profits.\nThe Court granted a dynamic injunction – as soon as the content was created, i.e.\nthe footage, it would be protected; and any illicit websites distributing it could be\nshut down as and when they arose without filing a case per violator.\nTHE COPYRIGHT OF A SCREENPLAY COMMISSIONED ON\nBEHALF OF A PRODUCER WOULD VEST WITH THE ORIGINAL\nAUTHOR\nRDB and Co. HUF v. HarperCollins Publishers India Pvt. Ltd.\nDate of Judgment: 23/05/2023\nIn this case, the question in dispute was whether the copyright of a screenplay\ncommissioned on behalf of a producer would vest within the original author or the\nproducer (Nayak by Satyajit Ray)\nThe Plaintiff being the producer, and the Defendants being the publishers,\nassumed copyright would fall with Satyajit Ray’s son and the Preservation Society\nrun by him. The Court held that while the copyright for the Plaintiff indubitably\nvests in the producer, this could not affect the copyright of the screenplay, which\nis a separate literary work, as the categories are distinct in the Copyright Act.\nSection 17 tells us that the author is the copyright owner, in this case Satyajit Ray\nPage 2 of 3(and now his estate) and not the producer even though it was written on request\nof the Plaintiff.\nTHE USE OF CELEBRITY NAMES AND IMAGES UNDER FAIR\nUSE CATEGORIES FALLS UNDER THE RIGHT OF FREEDOM OF\nSPEECH UNDER THE INDIAN CONSTITUTION\nDigital Collectibles Pte. Ltd. and Ors. vs Galactus Funware Technology\nPrivate Limited and Anr.\nDate of Judgment: 26/04/2023\nIn this case, the court declined to issue a temporary injunction against the gaming\nplatforms Mobile Premier League (MPL) & Striker for using the name and likeness\nof certain cricketers to create Non-Fungible Token (NFT) – enabled “Digital Player\nCards”.\nThe Hon’ble High Court of Delhi through reference of various judgements, noted\nthat the Use of celebrity names, images for the purpose of lampooning, satire,\nparodies, art, scholarship, music, academics, news and other similar uses would\nbe permissible as facets of right of freedom of speech and expression under\nArticle 19(1)(a) of the Constitution of India and would not fall foul to the tort of\ninfringement of the right of privacy.\nTHE USE OF GENERATIVE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE TO\nCREATE DEEPFAKES FOR COMMERCIAL PURPOSES IS NOT\nPERMITTED\nAnil Kapoor v. Simply Life India\nDate of Judgment: 20/09/2023\nThe Delhi High Court delivered a significant order in the case of Anil Kapoor v.\nSimply Life India & Ors, ruling in favor of the widely known Indian actor, Anil Kapoor.\nThe court issued an ex-parte order in response to Suit CS COMM 645 of 2023,\nwhere Kapoor sought protection for various facets of his personality that amounted\nto certain commercial value. These included his name, voice, dialogue delivery,\nimage likeness, gestures, signatures, and other elements, primarily concerning\ntheir misuse across the internet.\nIt was held that creation of merchandise, GIFs, and the use of generative Artificial\nIntelligence to create deepfakes for commercial purpose and the domain names\nusing the term Anil Kapoor cannot be allowed.\nCONTACT DETAILS\nLynn Lazaro Aparna Venkat\nResident Partner (Toronto) Senior Associate (Bangalore)\nlynn.lazaro@bgl.kochhar.com aparna.venkat@bgl.kochhar.com\nPage 3 of 3"}

Ltd. and Vibcare Pharma Pvt.\nLtd. in two separate suits.\nThe Delhi High Court in both cases found that the packaging and trade dress of\nMADHU JOSHANDA AYURVEDIC COUGH REMEDY and NURACUFF-\nAYURVEDIC MEDICINE FOR COUGH RELIEF were identical and deceptively\nsimilar to that of HONITUS. It held that Dabur had established a prima facie case\nof infringement of trademark and copyright against the defendants in each case. As\nthe balance of convenience was in favour of Dabur, the Court granted the interim\ninjunctions and restrained the respective defendants from using any trademark or\ntrade dress which was identical, deceptively similar or confusingly similar to the\nPlaintiff’s registered trademark HONITUS or bearing its well-known registered trade\ndress/label until further orders.\nRECTIFICATION AND CANCELLATION OF A TRADEMARK\nMacleods Pharmaceuticals Ltd. v. Union of India and others.\nPage 1 of 4Date of Judgment: 15/02/2023\nThe Petitioner, Macleods Pharmaceuticals Limited, challenged the order passed by\nthe Intellectual Property Appellate Board, Chennai (Respondent-2), which allowed\na Rectification application filed by Sun Pharmaceutical Ltd (Respondent-4) to\ncancel Macleods’ registered trademark OFLOMAC. The Bombay High Court\nconsidered various principles set out by the Apex court in its judgments and agreed\nwith the decision of the IPAB. The Court held that the rectification was in the interest\nof the general public as the marks were concerned with medicinal/pharmaceutical\nproducts and the decision was not without jurisdiction or in excess of its jurisdiction\nas it was passed after giving full opportunity to both the parties.\nIt was held that a stricter test should be applied while arriving at a conclusion with\nrespect to the similarity and confusion of pharmaceutical or medicinal products, and\nthe point of view of an ordinary common man of average intelligence should be\nconsidered instead of a specialized medical practitioner in judging the issue.\nFurther, the Court found that Macleods was unable to establish the actual use of its\nOFLOMAC mark prior to Sun Pharma’s use of its OFROMAX mark, and/or honest\nand concurrent use and therefore was not entitled to protection under Section 34\nand/or Section 12 of the Trademarks Act.\nCOURT RELIED ON PREVIOUS CONSENT ORDER\nKRBL Ltd. v. Vikram Roller Flour Mills Ltd.\nDate of Judgment: 19/01/2023\nThe Plaintiff KRBL Limited was a market leader in the business of processing,\ndistribution, and sale of rice under the trademark “INDIA GATE”. It had acquired\nrights to the mark through registration and an assignment deed from the\npredecessors who had been using the mark since 1979, and the Plaintiff itself had\nbeen using the mark continuously since 1993. The Plaintiff submitted that the\nDefendant’s act of selling dalia under the mark “INDIA GATE” was infringing upon\nthe Plaintiff’s rights. The Defendant submitted that it was the prior user of the INDIA\nGATE mark in respect of various wheat products, and relied on a consent order\nbetween the two parties. The Defendant claimed a right to expand its range of\nproducts, as ‘dalia’ was an allied and cognate product of ‘atta’.\nThe Delhi High Court agreed with the contentions of the Defendant, and relying\nupon the consent order, passed an interim order permitting the Defendant to sell\n‘dalia’ bearing the mark in respect of packaging of 20 kgs and above only. However,\nthe court also stated that such a consent order would not prejudice the exclusive\nright of the plaintiff to sell rice or any other product under the same mark.\nCOMPOSITE MARK WAS ONLY SUGGESTIVE – NOT\nDESCRIPTIVE\nUmang Dairies Limited vs Registrar Of Trade Marks\nDate of Judgment: 21/02/2023\nPage 2 of 4Umang Dairies Limited had filed a trademark application for a device mark for milk\nand milk products in Class 29. The subject mark was a composite device mark,\ncomprising of two words ‘WHITE’ and ‘MAGIK’, along with graphic representation\nof milk being poured in a hot cup of tea/ coffee. The Senior Examiner had rejected\nthe mark on the following grounds:\n- Section 9(1)(b) of the Act for being descriptive;\n- Sections 11(1)(a) and 11(1)(b) of the Act due to the existence of similar cited\nmarks;\n- No supporting documents on record claiming the use of the mark.\nUmang Dairies appealed this decision before the Delhi High Court.\nThe Court determined that, although ‘WHITE’ may be associated with milk and milk\nproducts, the combination of ‘WHITE’ and ‘MAGIK’ (alternative spelling of ‘MAGIC’),\nthe resulting mark ‘WHITE MAGIK’ was suggestive, not descriptive, of the applied\ngoods. Further, the Court found one cited mark to be abandoned, and other\nconflicting cited marks not to be similar to the subject mark except for the common\nword ‘MAGIC’/ ‘MAGIK’ used in all of them. In addition, on perusal of the court\nrecord, the Court noted that an affidavit demonstrating use had been filed for the\nsubject mark, which escaped the attention of the Senior Examiner, despite being\non record on the date of hearing i.e., 24th April, 2019.\nThe Court set aside the order of the Examiner and ordered the Trademarks Registry\nto process the application for the subject mark and advertise it within 3 months, with\na clarification that the subject mark will not grant any exclusive rights to the words\n‘WHITE’ or ‘DIARY CREAMER’, either separately or individually.\nTRADEMARK OFFICE MAY NOT DENY REGISTRATION WHEN\nTHERE ARE OTHER VARIED REGISTRATIONS OF THE MARK\nVR Asset Management Pte. Ltd. vs Examiner Of Trade Marks\nDate of Judgment: 23/02/2023\nAn order was passed by the Examiner of Trademarks, Delhi, rejecting a trademark\napplication under Section 9(1)(b) of the Act, which stated that the mark VIRTUOUS\nRETAIL was devoid of distinctive character and there were no affidavit and\nsupporting documents on record. This was appealed by the owner, as the company\nalready owned a word mark registration in the same class.\nThe Court set aside the order, holding that it was not appropriate for the Trade\nMarks Office to refuse the registration of the mark/logo in the subject application\nwhen there were various registrations granted to the appellant in respect of the\nmark/logo and other formative marks in various classes.\nTRADEAMARK REGISTRY MUST CONSIDER PREVIOUS\nSETTLEMENT AGREEMENT BEFORE PASSING ORDERS\nSurender Kumar vs Registrar Trade Marks\nPage 3 of 4Date of Judgment: 17/02/2023\nAn appeal under section 91 of the Trade Marks Act, 1999 was filed against an order\nrefusing registration for the Appellant’s mark “CANON”. The senior examiner had\nobjected to the registration under Sections 11(a) and (b) of the Trademarks Act, on\nthe ground that the mark looked identical or similar to an earlier registered\ntrademark.\nThe Court held that passing orders without considering a binding agreement of\nsettlement with the proprietor of the earlier registered mark despite it being brought\nto notice was not sustainable. It directed the Trade Marks Registry to process the\nregistration of application and set aside the impugned order.\nREFERENCE TO A BRAND IN SOCIAL MEDIA AMOUNTS TO\nINFRINGEMENT\nDabur India Limited vs Dhruv Rathee and Ors.\nDate of Judgment: 15/03/2023\nIn a case filed by Dabur, the Calcutta High Court asked a social media influencer\nto remove reference to Real fruit juice products from his video. In the video, Dhruv\nRathee, who claims to be a social media influencer, compared the health effects of\nconsuming Real packaged fruit juice with consuming soft drinks and fresh juice and\nopined that packaged fruit juice has negative health effects. Aggrieved, Dabur went\nto Court, and the Court agreed with Dabur that the reference to its real brand was\ndenigrating and disparaging and that the use of the brand and packaging amounts\nto trademark and copyright infringement. The Court, therefore, ordered the removal\nof the brand references from the video.\nCONTACT DETAILS\nLynn Lazaro Aparna Venkat\nResident Partner (Toronto) Senior Associate (Bangalore)\nlynn.lazaro@bgl.kochhar.com aparna.venkat@bgl.kochhar.com\nPage 4 of 4"}

Chennai\nEmail: ram@chennai.kochhar.com January 2023\nIntroduction.\nMetaverse, the term coined by Neal Stephenson in his cyberpunk novel, Snow Crash.,\nmeans beyond-universe. Metaverse is a concept evolved from the internet, which is\nmade of shared 3D virtual spaces. A digital representation of people or “Avatars,” can\nlive, work and play in a metaverse. The Metaverse is a persistent virtual space. Which\nmeans, it does not vanish when you quit, but stays there for other people to use.\nBut I’ve spoken enough about what the Metaverse is, and this is my fourth article in\nthe NFT series. The readers are welcome to read my earlier articles to get your basics\non NFTs and Metaverse.\nSeveral companies have taken the path of Metaverse. Tech companies ranging from\nlarge multinational corporations to startups, are now in line for a taste of the Metaverse\nand to secure their permanent position in the world of Metaverse. Significant amounts\nof money are being invested and even properties are being bought in metaverses for\nmassive amounts of dollars. The Metaverse has already proven its potential to\nrevolutionize the marketing industry and numerous brands have already successfully\nmigrated to offering a bespoke experience to their virtual customers.\nI know what most of you are thinking by now. All these companies on the line, in a\nspace that was virtually unknown until very recently, several knowns and unknowns,\nso, what about disputes? I’m coming to that.\nDispute Resolution in the Metaverse.\nIt is said that, the disputes that arise from transactions in the Metaverse will come back\nto the Metaverse for resolution of the same. Yes, that’s right. Dispute resolution in the\nMetaverse. But how?\nIn November 2022, the Guangzhou Arbitration Commission (GZAC) reported on its\nsocial media platform that its Metaverse Arbitration Court awarded the first case\ninvolving the virtual world.\nThe GZAC set up the first Metaverse Arbitration Court, Meta City (Yuanbang)\nArbitration Court, in July 2022. It is located in the main building of Meta City Hall, the\nScales Floating Island, making it the first Metaverse arbitration court worldwide.\nPage 1 of 4Now let’s talk about the first metaverse arbitration that was awarded by the GZAC. It\nall started when a Hong Kong-funded company, upon the knowledge that the GZAC\nhad set up the Metaverse Arbitration Institute, approached them.\nIn July 2022, the Hong Kong-funded Internet investment company sold a digital avatar\nof a mechanical armor image to a bar owner in Guangzhou through marketing in the\nMetaverse. At the end of August, the Hong Kong-funded company discovered that the\ndigital avatar was printed on the cultural shirts of the buyer's bar for promotion.\nAccording to the agreement between the two parties, the digital avatar cannot be used\nin the real world. Terming the above as a violation, the Hong Kong Company\ndemanded compensation from the buyer.\nThe parties then agreed to resolve the dispute by arbitration and decided to file a case\nthrough Metaverse and submit the dispute to the Metaverse Arbitration Court for\nresolution.\nHuang Minxin, an arbitrator in the case said that, after obtaining the digital image, one\nparty in this case applied it to offline clothing printing and planned to sell it, which\naffected reflected the copyright income when the digital collection and virtual image\nwere transferred offline. Finally, under the witness of the arbitrator, the Hong Kong-\nfunded company granted new authorizations to digital image holders and users, and\nthe users properly shared the benefits with the Hong Kong-funded company.\nIt only took 5 days from the acceptance to the settlement of the Metaverse virtual\nproperty dispute case. \"In the era of the digital economy, both parties to the transaction\nare affected by flow thinking. The large amount of funds occupied and financial profits\nbased on supply and demand in a short period of time make such disputes often\nurgent. If they are not resolved in time, the economic The loss will increase several\ntimes or even dozens of times.” Huang Minxin told reporters.\nThe Technology.\nThe Metaverse Arbitration Court basically bypassed the limitations of the three-\ndimensional world and perfectly reproduced the trial. The GZAC ventured on the\nintegration of internet and law and they seem to be doing it right.\nIt is however pertinent to note that, not only was a dispute of this kind was\nunprecedented, but due to factors such as privacy and technicality, there were new\nchallenges to the mechanism.\nThe trial mechanism of the Metaverse Arbitration Court pays more attention to privacy\nprotection. The arbitration room is password protected, which is only known to the\narbitrator and the parties, leaving no chances of interruptions.\nIt is interesting to know that, the GZAC also launched a new intelligent product - \"Yun\nXiaozhong\" robot. The \"Yun Xiaozhong\" robot has the advantages of high\ntechnological content, uninterrupted service, simple operation interface, flexible and\nconvenient actions, etc. The GZAC also launched the “virtual arbitrator” function. The\narbitrators who hear the cases can quickly obtain relevant legal provisions and judicial\ninterpretations from the \"virtual arbitrator\" through real-time interactive means such as\nvoice and typing, and search for relevant precedents in the judicial database. While\nthe final judgment is still made by the arbitrator, it cannot be denied that it greatly\nreduces the workload of the arbitrator.\nPage 2 of 4So what else has China been upto?\nIt appears that our neighbours have quite a few ambitious projects in its pipeline. In\nearly July 2022, Shanghai released its metaverse development initiative from 2022 to\n2025, which aims to achieve $52.19 billion (350 billion RMB) for metaverse-related\nindustries in 2025 and incubate ten “internationally competitive” enterprises in the\ndominant position. Shanghai and Guangzhou have unveiled ambitious digital economy\ndevelopment plans that explicitly identify the metaverse and digital collectibles as two\nsectors with immense growth potential.\nAt the same time, it is interesting to note that China has strict regulations targeting the\nsecondary transactions of digital collectibles.\nThe Chinese government prohibits NFTs to be issued and traded in China out of\nconcern that they will be used as de facto cryptocurrencies. In April 2022, the National\nInternet Finance Association of China, the China Banking Association, and the\nSecurities Association of China issued a joint call for guarding against NFT’s financial\nrisks. In early July, about 30 digital collectibles-related organizations, (including\nTencent, Alibaba, Baidu, and JD.com), jointly issued a self-disciplined development\nproposal for the sector under the guidance of the state-affiliated China Cultural Industry\nAssociation.\nThe proposal states that digital collectibles platforms should have “relevant and\nappropriate credentials” to operate. Steps are even being made to ensure that only the\nRMB is adopted as the transaction currency.\nMeanwhile, what else has been happening in the other parts of the world? That’s right.\nThere’s more.\nAbu Dhabi launches Mediation in the Metaverse.\nThe Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM) Arbitration Centre launched the world’s first\n“mediation in the metaverse”.\nMediation is a consensual process and settlements of disputes help preserve business\nrelationships and company resources. And with the advent of Web3 technology,\nADGM hopes to provide a more immersive experience, enhancing virtual mediation by\nallowing the participants to access a 3D office space. ADGM aims to increase the\nreach of mediation to parties who wish to explore a resolution of their dispute on their\nown terms.\nConclusion.\nThough the evolution of Metaverse to include real world necessities such as the\ndispute resolution is commendable, this is only the beginning and there’s a long way\nto go before it is perfected. We are also yet to see blockchain contracts properly\nincorporate dispute resolution mechanisms and blockchain arbitration still has a\nnumber of issues to address such as, accessibility by non-tech-savvy applicability of\nlocal statutes, the New York Convention, limitations to inferences through digital\navatars in contrast to a trial with parties present physically etc.\nPage 3 of 4While I personally look forward to experiencing an arbitration on platform such as the\nabove and yes, it is exciting, but we will have to wait before parties get a complete\nunderstanding of how it works and how lucrative it would be for all those who\nparticipate in the same. I do await the day where I, along with my able and highly\ncompetent team at Kochhar & Co., enter the Metaverse as we do in the High Courts\nand Tribunals, and conduct trials through our avatars. The future does seem to promise\nsome excitement for the legal community too.\nSources:\ni. https://www.chinajusticeobserver.com/a/chinese-arbitral-institution-awards-china-\ns-first-property-dispute-case-in-the-metaverse\nii. https://www.tellerreport.com/life/2022-11-15-guangzhou-arbitration-commission-\nsets-up-metaverse-arbitration-court-to-handle-cases-involving-virtual-\nworlds.SydVVt-Us.html\niii. https://jingdaily.com/china-metaverse-duality-tencent-shanghai-guangzhou/\niv. https://www.adgm.com/media/announcements/abu-dhabi-global-market-\nlaunches-mediation-in-the-metaverse\n-§-\nPage 4 of 4"}

New Delhi\nYaashna Thakran Senior Associate, Kochhar & Co. New Delhi\nDecember 2022\nThis write-up is a brief discussion on the continuance of proceedings in relation to\navoidance of preferential, under-valued, fraudulent or extortionate transactions\n(“PUFE transactions”)1 as defined under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016\n(“Code”), after approval of a resolution plan.\nAs per the 5th report of Insolvency Law Committee, sections 43-51, 66 and 67 of the\nCode which deal with avoidance of PUFE transactions, are amongst others primarily\naimed at swelling the asset pool that is available for distribution to creditors and\npreventing unjust enrichment of one party at the expense of other creditors.\nIn tandem with such aim, regulation 40A of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of\nIndia (Insolvency Resolution Process for Corporate Persons) Regulations, 2016\n(“CIRP Regulations”) requires the resolution professional to determine PUFE\ntransactions on or before the 115th day from the commencement of the corporate\ninsolvency resolution process (“CIRP”), and to file applications before the Adjudicating\nAuthority for avoidance of PUFE transactions within 135 days of commencement of\nCIRP. However, given that the CIRP of a corporate Debtor has to be mandatorily\nconcluded within a period of 330 days (including all extensions from the date of\nadmission into CIRP), coupled with the delay that commonly occurs in disposal of\nordinary lis, applications in relation to avoidance of PUFE transactions in relation to a\ncorporate debtor often remains unadjudicated by the time the CIRP of such corporate\ndebtor is concluded.\nAs a result, applications for avoidance of PUFE transactions were considered\ninfructuous upon conclusion of the CIRP. This issue was highlighted in the matter of\nVenus Recruiters Private Limited vs. Union of India & Ors. (decided on November 26,\n2020)2. The High Court of Delhi in the said matter held that the Adjudicating Authority\ndid not have jurisdiction to hear applications under section 43 of the Code after the\napproval of a resolution plan. It observed that the applications qua PUFE transactions\nare neither for the benefit of the resolution applicant, nor for the corporate debtor after\ncompletion of CIRP, and that such applications are for the benefit of the committee of\ncreditors (“CoC”) of the corporate debtor. It was also observed by the court that the\nresolution professional whose mandate ends with the conclusion of the CIRP, cannot\nindirectly seek to give benefit to the corporate debtor who is under the control of the\nnew management/ resolution applicant, by pursuing such applications. However, the\nabove was subject to the existence of any clause in the resolution plan which permitted\n1 Sections 43-51, 66 and 67 of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016\n2 2020 SCC OnLine Del 1479\nPage 1 of 2the resolution professional to function for any specific purpose beyond the approval of\nresolution plan.\nThe Insolvency Law Committee in its 5th report of May 2022, deliberated on the issue\nwhich was highlighted in the matter of Venus Recruiters Private Limited vs. Union of\nIndia & Ors., and considering the import of section 26 of the Code, suggested that\nproceedings related to PUFE transactions should be considered independent of the\nCIRP. Accordingly, the Committee concluded that proceedings in respect of PUFE\ntransactions may continue beyond the timeline for the CIRP.3\nConsideration the suggestion of the Committee, regulation 38(2)(d) was inserted to the\nCIRP Regulations on June 14, 2022, vide which it was made mandatory for a resolution\napplicant to set out in the resolution plan itself, the manner in which the proceedings\nfor PUFE transactions were to be conducted after approval of the resolution plan, and\nthe manner in which the proceeds, if any, from such proceedings shall be distributed.\nThere is no doubt that this amendment would certainly hold the suspended\nmanagement of the corporate debtor to a greater degree of accountability and allow\nthe corporate debtor to recover and distribute amounts which it otherwise may not have\nbeen able obtain owing to completion of CIRP. However, while a resolution applicant\nappears to have been given the discretion to decide the manner in which such\nproceeds would be distributed, one can only wonder if the COC would be agreeable\nto approve a plan which provides for distribution of such proceeds to creditors other\nthan to itself. Further, while such proceeds or part thereof, may be received well after\nthe approval of a resolution plan, since the manner of its distribution has to be spelt\nout in the resolution plan itself, the distribution envisaged may have to be in\nconsonance with the principle of non-discriminatory payouts to creditors of the same\nclass. While most resolution applicants would choose to err on the side of caution, it\nwould be interesting to see if resolution applicants may also choose to distribute such\nproceeds as additional amounts to strategic partners who are essential for the survival\nof the corporate debtor post the approval of the resolution plan. Given the objective of\nthe Code, there appears to exist good reasons for both the COC and the judicial forums\nto approve such a choice.\n-§-\nThe Article is also published on MONDAQ\nhttps://www.mondaq.com/india/insolvencybankruptcy/1260426/continuation-of-proceedings-in-\nrelation-to-avoidance-transactions-after-acceptance-of-resolution-plan\n3 Section 2.22 of the 5th report of Insolvency Law Committee of May 2022\nPage 2 of 2"}
{"Title": "Unconventional trademark – Sound mark", "Publication_Date": "7 March 2023", "URL": "https://kochhar.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Kochhar-Co.-Bangalore.-Article-by-Aparna-Venkat-Unconventional-trademark-Sound-mark-Feb-2023-.pdf", "Content": "Unconventional trademark - Sound mark\nBy Aparna Venkat February 2023\nA trademark is a brand or logo that represents one’s business. In simple words, it\nis an identity. The conventional and traditional trademarks such as plain words,\ndevices, logos, designs, labels and packages have been used since long for\ndistinguishing goods and services. Over time, other elements besides words, logos,\ncolour combinations and graphic designs have come to serve as identifiers of the\nsource of goods/services, thus serving the function of trademarks. The concept of\ntrademark function can be examined based on the rudimentary essentials a mark\nneeds to satisfy such as being inherently distinctive, indicating commercial origin of\nproducts/ services, creating a nexus serving as a source identifier thereby holding\nan exclusive identity.\nUnconventional marks go beyond the traditional trademarks in nature,\ncharacteristics, scope and economic potentials. The following are the main\ncategories of non-traditional trademarks that can be registered.\ni. Sound/aural marks/audio signature,\nii. Smell/scent/olfactory marks,\niii. Tactile/touch/texture/haptic marks,\niv. Single colour marks,\nv. Shape marks/three dimensional/3D marks,\nvi. Taste/gustatory marks,\nvii. Holograms; and\nviii. Moving images/motion/animated marks.\nEach kind of unconventional trademark presents challenges in terms of meeting\none of the basic criteria of a trademark i.e., ‘a mark must be capable of being\nrepresented graphically’. Over the course of time, measures are undertaken in such\na manner either to accommodate the requirement or amend the procedures to\nmake way for the new emerging trends.\nSound Mark\nThis write up will focus on the registrability of a Sound Mark under the Trade Marks\nAct, 1999. (Act). The definition of the term “mark” and “trademark” under Sections\n2(1)(m) and 2(1)(zg) respectively is inclusive and not exhaustive of accommodating\nregistration of a sound mark within the existing framework of the Act. Sound/ Music\nis one of the best channels to be employed for marketing a product/ service, as it\n1is etched in the minds of the public more rapidly than any other type of a source\nidentifier. It acts as an audio signature.\nThe whole idea is to recognize and protect varied untapped potential elements in\nthe market that serves as the origin of a source and links the public to a commercial\nbusiness, sound mark being one of them. The art of launching products into the\nmarket by organizations along with a song, jingle, tune, chimes, etc., has been in\npractice for the longest time and subconsciously it seeks indefinite refuge in our\nhead making it memorable and immortal which provides an edge to the\norganization, thereby providing exclusivity. Also, there exists a persuasive ability\nto embed messages in the minds of the consumers.\nProcedure to file a Sound Mark\nThere was no mention of registering a sound mark under the Trade Marks Rules,\n2002 (Rules), yet few proprietors registered their sound mark. On August 18, 2008,\na sound mark registration was granted to Sunnyvale, California-based Internet firm\nYahoo Inc.’s three-note Yahoo yodel by the Delhi branch of the Trademark Registry.\nIt was registered in classes 35, 38 and 42 for a series of goods including email,\nadvertising and business services and managing websites.\nPost the amendment of the Rules in 2017, Rule 26(5) provides provisions to file\nand register a sound as a trademark. Requirements for filing:\na. Submit recording in MP3 format not exceeding 30 seconds,\nb. Clearly audible and capable of replaying, and\nc. Graphical representation of its musical notations.\nThe procedure to assess the registrability of a sound mark thereafter is same as\nthat of any other mark filed before the Office of the Trade Marks Registry relating\nto preliminary objections, examination reports, evidentiary documents, acceptance\nand advertising a mark, opposition and registration.\nFew other registered sound marks are, Tarzans yell (TM# 1748778 [2015]),\nNational Stock Exchange (theme song) ( TM# 2152244 [2016]), ICICI Bank\n(Corporate jingle) (TM# 1807772 [2018]), Britannia Industries (four note bell sound)\n(TM# 1904243 [2011]), Eicher Motors (TM# 3044834 [2017]), Reliance Industries,\n(TM# 3838573 [2018]) Tata Coffee ( TM# 4211214 [2021]), Netflix (TM# 5236448 [\n2023]), etc.\nCopyright and Sound mark overlap\nAs per Rule 26(5) of the Rules, only a 30 second segment of a musical work is\nsubjected to sound mark protection under the Act. The remaining music will\ncontinue to be protected under the Copyright Act, 1957. Also, Section 11(3)(b) of\nthe Act prohibits registration of a trademark if its use in India is prevented by the\nlaw of copyright. While this being so, the circumstances surrounding each sound\nmark application will determine the proper course of action with respect to adducing\nrelevant documents of evidentiary value, that includes no objection certificate,\nagreements between parties with respect to transfer of rights or any other form of\narrangements, to ensure proper and clean title to the sound mark.\n2Conclusion\nThe amendment of the Rules in 2017 has streamlined the process of registering a\nsound mark by making it fairly simple. Like any other subject matter, over a period\nof time, many nuances will unfold and as the unconventional nature of the mark\nitself, the measures to tackle them will likely differ from the conventional manner of\nadjudging and enforcing the rights vested in such marks.\n-§-\n3"}

LL.B., 2025, Xavier Law School, XIM University, Bhubaneswar\nMr. Ramasamy Santhanakrishnan Partner, Kochhar & Co. Chennai\nEmail: ram@chennai.kochhar.com\nApril 2023\nIntroduction to Competition Law:\nThe Black Law Dictionary defines Competition as an offer by an entity that is just as good\nas what else is out there and is an attractive buy. In simple words a win by defeating or\nestablishing supremacy. However, it cannot be denied that competition encourages firms\nto innovate, improve quality and present their products/services at suitable prices. We\nalso cannot overlook the concomitant worries that surface with competition viz., price\nfixing, collusion, abuse of market power, unfavourable mergers and acquisitions, etc.\nThis gives rise to the need for laws governing and regulating competition in the market.\nThe Competition Laws of India offer guidance for the regulation of the market by\nsafeguarding the interests of consumers from anti-competitive behaviour in the market\nand ensuring freedom and liberty to trade in the market.\nAnti-competitive practices can lead to higher prices, and products that do not justify the\nprices, reduce motivation for innovation, and ultimately, consumers are left with a\nminimum choice.\nFurther, the Competition laws prohibit false or misleading representations, offers, or\nadvertisements, and ensure that consumers are not deceived by businesses that exploit\ntheir market power to their advantage and benefit unjustly.\nCompetition laws promote economic growth, and job creation in the market and help in\ncreating a level playing field for businesses of all sizes.\nFurthermore, by regulating mergers and acquisitions that may have adverse effects on\ncompetition, competition law can prevent the formation of monopolies and oligopolies\nthat can harm consumers and businesses alike. The Competition Commission of India\n(CCI) evaluates the potential impact of mergers and acquisitions on competition and\n1approves or rejects them or imposes conditions, as may be appropriate, to ensure that\ncompetition is not harmed.\nObjectives of the Competition Act, 2002:\nThe Competition Act, 2002 (the Act), governs competition in India. Amendments have\nbeen introduced over the years to strengthen the regulatory framework and enhance its\neffectiveness. CCI is the regulatory body established under the Act, responsible for\nensuring the enforcement of the provisions of the Act. The CCI has the power to\ninvestigate and penalize anti-competitive practices and regulate mergers and\nacquisitions to ensure that they result in no unfair consequences to the competition in\nthe market. The Act also outlines the rights and responsibilities of market players,\nincluding businesses, consumers, and the government, in promoting and maintaining fair\ncompetition in the Indian market. The Act also provides for the establishment of the\nCompetition Appellate Tribunal (CAT) to hear appeals against the decisions of the CCI.\nPast amendments to Competition Act, 2002:\nSince its enactment in 2002, the Act has undergone several amendments to strengthen\nthe regulatory framework and enhance its effectiveness. Some of the notable\namendments to the act are:\ni) The Competition (Amendment) Act, 2007: This amendment introduced the\nconcept of 'Combinations,' which includes mergers, amalgamations, and\nacquisitions, and provided the CCI with the power to scrutinize combinations that\nhave an adverse effect on competition.\nii) The Competition (Amendment) Act, 2009: This amendment strengthened the\nregulatory framework by providing the CCI with more powers to investigate and\npenalize anti-competitive practices. It also introduced the concept of 'Leniency' for\nbusinesses that cooperate with the CCI in its investigations.\niii) The Competition (Amendment) Act, 2012: This amendment introduced the\nconcept of 'Individual Liability' for individuals involved in anti-competitive practices\nand provided for the establishment of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT)\nand the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) to hear appeals\nagainst the decisions of the CCI.\niv) The Competition (Amendment) Act, 2020: This amendment further\nstrengthened the regulatory framework by providing for the establishment of the\nCompetition Law Review Committee (CLRC) to review the competition law in\nIndia and make recommendations for its improvement. It also introduced the\nconcept of 'Green Channel,' which fast-tracks the approval process for certain\ncategories of mergers and acquisitions that do not have an adverse effect on\ncompetition.\nBrief Introduction to Competition Amendment Bill, 2022:\nThe Competition Amendment Bill 2022 was introduced in the Lok Sabha on February\n28, 2022, with the aim of amending the Competition Act, 2002, which governs\n2competition law in India. The bill was passed by both houses of Parliament and received\nPresidential assent on August 1, 2022.\nThe Competition Amendment Bill 2022 introduces several significant changes to the\nexisting competition law framework in India. The bill aims to strengthen the Competition\nCommission of India's (CCI) ‘s ability to regulate anti-competitive behaviour in the market\nand improve its functioning. The proposed changes cover a wide range of areas, from\nthe composition and workings of the CCI to the rule-making powers of the government\nand the CCI.\nThe key features of the Competition Amendment Bill 2022 are as follows:\n1. Introduction of Green Channel Clearance:\nOne of the most significant changes introduced by the Competition Amendment Bill 2022\nis the introduction of Green Channel Clearance. This provision allows for a fast-track\napproval process for certain categories of mergers and acquisitions that are considered\nto be non-controversial.\n2. Increase in Threshold for Combination Review:\nThe Competition Amendment Bill 2022 has also increased the threshold for combination\nreview. Earlier, only combinations with a combined asset value of Rs. 1,000 crore or\nmore, or a combined turnover of Rs. 3,000 crore or more, were subject to review by the\nCCI. However, the Amendment Bill has increased these thresholds to Rs. 4,000 crore\nand Rs. 12,000 crore, respectively.\n3. Provision for Appointment of Additional Members:\nThe Competition Amendment Bill 2022 has introduced a provision that allows for the\nappointment of additional members to the CCI. One of the significant changes proposed\nin the bill is the requirement for CCI members to have experience in technology.\nAdditionally, those on the selection committee must also have knowledge of and\nexperience in the field. The additional members can be appointed for a period of up to\nfive years and can be reappointed for one more term.\n4. Expansion of Definition of Cartels:\nThe Competition Amendment Bill 2022 has also expanded the definition of cartels. The\nbill has included \"buyer's cartels\" and \"hub and spoke\" agreements under the definition\nof cartels. This change is aimed at curbing anti-competitive practices and ensuring that\nbusinesses cannot collude to fix prices or restrict supply in any way.\n5. Introduction of Penalty on Misleading Information:\nThe Competition Amendment Bill 2022 has introduced a penalty for providing misleading\ninformation to the CCI during the course of an investigation. The penalty can be up to\none percent of the total turnover or the assets of the concerned party, whichever is\nhigher.\n36. Introduction of Settlement Mechanism:\nThe Competition Amendment Bill 2022 has introduced a settlement mechanism for\ncases of anti-competitive agreements and abuse of dominance. The settlement\nmechanism allows parties to settle cases with the CCI by admitting to the violation and\npaying a penalty.\n7. Alteration in Rule Making Powers of the Government and CCI:\nThe bill also proposes to provide the government with certain additional rule-making\npowers. The central government will be allowed to issue notifications addressing the\nvalue of assets or turnover in case of mergers and acquisitions, the percentage of voting\nrights to determine \"group\" entities, and the criteria of combinations.\nThe CCI will also be given additional powers to frame regulations, including the manner\nof determination of substantial business operations in India, the form and fee for the\nnotice for a combination, the time and manner for filing the notice of acquisition, the\nmanner of determining turnover or income, and the amount of any penalty for any\ncontravention of the provisions of the Act.\n8. Modification in relevant market definition:\nThe Act provides a definition of \"relevant market\" under Section 2(r). According to the\nAct, a relevant market refers to a market comprising of a specific product or service and\na geographic area in which it is sold. The definition of the relevant market is an essential\nelement in assessing the impact of competition on market practices. The Competition\nCommission of India (CCI) determines the relevant market while examining anti-\ncompetitive agreements, abuse of dominant position, and mergers and acquisitions.\nThe definition of the relevant market is crucial in determining the dominant position of an\nenterprise in the market. The CCI considers an enterprise to be dominant if it has a\nsignificant share of the relevant market, which enables it to operate independently of\nmarket forces and consumers. Overall, the definition of the relevant market is an\nessential tool for analysing and regulating competition in India. It helps the CCI to identify\nanti-competitive practices and promotes a level playing field for enterprises operating in\nthe market.\nThe Competition Commission of India (CCI) uses six factors to identify the relevant\nproduct market under the Competition Law prevailing in India. These factors are:\nPhysical characteristics and end-use of the product or service\n• Consumer preferences\n• Price\n• Supply-side substitutability\n• Geographical factors\n• Regulatory factors\n4Overall, the six factors outlined above provide a comprehensive framework for identifying\nthe relevant product market and are crucial in determining the competitive landscape of\nthe market. The CCI uses these factors to identify the relevant product market while\nexamining anti-competitive agreements, abuse of dominant position, and mergers and\nacquisitions.\nThe 2022 bill also modifies the definition of the \"relevant product market\" and\n\"relevant geographic market\" used by the CCI. The new definition of the \"relevant\nproduct market\" will look at substitutability on the supply side, in addition to the\nexisting consumer perspective. The earlier definition only considered two\nproducts or services to be part of the same relevant market if it is regarded as\ninterchangeable or substitutable by the consumer. The new definition considers\ntwo products as part of the same relevant market even if the production or supply\nof the two is regarded as interchangeable or substitutable by the supplier.\nTwo additional factors have been added to the existing six factors that CCI uses to\nidentify the “relevant product market”:\na) Costs associated with switching demand or supply to other goods or services, and\nb) Categories of customers.\nTwo more factors have been added to the list of factors used by CCI to determine the\n“relevant geographic market”:\na) Characteristics of goods or nature of services, and\nb) Costs associated with switching supply or demand to other areas.\n9. Transparency in the process of issuing regulations and guidelines:\nThe Bill proposes new sections that outline a transparent process for issuing regulations\nand guidelines. Before issuing any regulations, CCI will have to publish draft regulations\nand solicit public comments, and then publish a general statement that responds to the\ncomments received.\n10. Other proposed changes:\n➢ The Bill proposes several other changes, including a three-year limitation period for\ncomplaints, after which CCI will not entertain any complaint unless there are valid\nreasons given by the parties.\n➢ Parties under investigation can now call upon experts from various fields, including\neconomics, commerce, international trade, or any other discipline, for their opinion in\nrelation to a case before the Commission. Previously, only officers of the company or\nchartered accountants or legal practitioners could appear.\n➢ The bill also proposes to give the Director General more investigative powers to carry\nout an investigation, such as demanding all records of a company under\ninvestigation, examining company officials under oath, obtaining assistance from the\npolice, and requesting seizure of information.\n5Competition (Amendment) Bill, 2023:\nCompetition (Amendment) Bill 2023 is the latest amendment to the Competition Act\n2002, which was introduced by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs in the Lok Sabha on 7th\nFebruary 2023. The Bill received the assent of the President of India on 12th April, 2023.\nThe Bill aims to further strengthen the competition regime in India and promote fair\ncompetition in the market.\nOther than few proposed changes that are already mentioned in the analysis of the 2022\nBill, The Competition (Amendment) Bill, 2023 includes the following important changes:\n1. Mergers and Acquisitions are reviewed by the CCI:\nThe 2023 Bill has proposed that if the value of a merger or acquisition is greater than\n₹2000 Crores, it will require CCI approval, provided the party being acquired or\namalgamated has significant business operations in India. This is a departure from the\nprevious requirement, where only assets or turnover exceeding a certain threshold\nneeded to be notified to the CCI. The new deal value threshold will cover cases of \"killer\nacquisitions\" where large companies acquire struggling start-up companies, as seen in\nFacebook's acquisition of WhatsApp and Instagram. The deal value threshold will be\nreviewed and updated periodically by the government based on various factors.\nAs of April 2023, the Competition Act in India has been amended several times, with the\nlatest amendments made in 2022. The amendments have revised the thresholds for\nnotifying mergers and acquisitions to the CCI.\nThe existing threshold for mergers and acquisitions as per the Competition Act 2022,\nwhich is currently applicable, is as follows:\n✓ For a merger or acquisition involving enterprises with assets of over INR 5000 crores\n($671 million) in India or turnover of over INR 15000 crores ($2 billion) in India, a\nmandatory notification to the CCI is required.\n✓ For a merger or acquisition involving enterprises with assets between INR 1000\ncrores ($134 million) and INR 5000 crores ($671 million) or turnover between INR\n3000 crores ($403 million) and INR 15000 crores ($2 billion) in India, a notification to\nthe CCI is required if the combined market share of the enterprises exceeds 25% in\nthe relevant market in India.\n✓ For a merger or acquisition involving enterprises with assets less than INR 1000\ncrores ($134 million) or turnover less than INR 3000 crores ($403 million) in India, no\nnotification to the CCI is required.\n2. Reduces the time limit for the assessment of combinations by the CCI:\nAs per the Competition Act 2002, the time limit for the assessment of combinations by\nthe CCI was 210 calendar days from the date of filing the notice of the combination with\nthe CCI.\n6However, the Competition Amendment Act 2022 amended this time limit to 150 “working”\ndays from the date of filing the notice of the combination with the CCI, as mentioned in\nmy previous response. But the 2023 Bill has reduced the time limit for the assessment\nof combinations by the CCI from 150 “working” days to 150 “calendar” days.\nThe 150-day time limit is applicable to both cases where the combination is deemed to\nhave been approved by the CCI (in cases where the CCI does not raise any objections\nwithin the 150-day time limit) and cases where the CCI requires modifications or\nconditions to be imposed on the combination (in cases where the CCI raises objections\nwithin the 150-day time limit).\nIt is important to note that in exceptional circumstances, as per the 2023 Bill, the CCI\nmay extend the 150-day time limit by up to 30 calendar days, subject to reasons to be\nrecorded in writing. The 2022 Bill had sought to reduce the timeline within which the CCI\nwould have to form a prima facie opinion on the likelihood of a combination causing\nappreciable adverse effect on competition from 30 working days to 20 calendar days.\nHowever, the CCI must inform the parties to the combination of the extension of the time\nlimit and the reasons for the same. Within 30 calendar days, the CCI needs to form its\ninitial opinion, failing which the combination is deemed approved.\nIf the CCI identifies an appreciable adverse effect on competition, it will state its\nobjections and direct the parties to explain why such a combination should be allowed.\nThe parties may propose modifications to address the competition concerns, which the\nCCI may approve or reject. If the proposed modifications are rejected, the combination\nwill not be allowed, or the CCI can propose a scheme for the parties to implement to\naddress the concerns.\n3. Section 3 of The Competition Act, 2002 broadened:\nSection 3 of the Act deals with anti-competitive agreements. It prohibits any\nagreement between enterprises, including cartels, which causes or is likely to cause an\nappreciable adverse effect on competition within India. Such agreements may relate to\nprice-fixing, bid-rigging, market-sharing, or limiting the production or supply of goods or\nservices.\nThe latest amendment to Section 3 was made in 2022 through the Competition\nAmendment Act. The amendment introduced a de minimis threshold for anti-competitive\nagreements, below which such agreements will not be considered anti-competitive. The\nthreshold is set at 1% of the turnover of each enterprise or 15 Crores, whichever is lower,\nin the relevant market.\nThe amendment aims to ensure that only those anti-competitive agreements that have\na significant impact on competition are investigated and penalized by the CCI. It also\nreduces the compliance burden on enterprises by exempting them from reporting\nagreements that fall below the de minimis threshold.\nHowever, it is important to note that the de minimis threshold does not\napply to hardcore cartels or agreements that involve horizontal price-fixing, market-\n7sharing, or output limitations. Such agreements are still considered per se illegal and can\nattract penalties under Section 27 of the Act.\nSection 3 on anti-competitive agreements has been broadened to cover\nhub-and-spoke cartels. Entities not engaged in identical or similar trade are now\npresumed to be part of an anti-competitive agreement if they participate in its\nfurtherance. This includes parties that facilitate collusion, such as consultants or trade\nassociations. Additionally, the phrase \"exclusive supply agreement\" has been replaced\nwith \"exclusive dealing agreement\" to cover exclusive agreements on the selling side.\nAnti-competitive conduct like \"tie-in arrangement,\" \"refusal to deal,\" \"resale\nprice maintenance,\" and \"exclusive distribution agreement\" have also been redefined to\ncover goods and services, and not just goods. Indirect restrictions are now included in\nthe definition of \"resale price maintenance.\"\nIt is said that the appreciable adverse effect on competition in India (AAEC) occurs when\ncertain practices restrict competition. AAEC can take three forms: Anti-competitive\nagreement, Abuse of dominance and Combinations. Specifically, Section 19(3) of the\nAct states that the Competition Commission of India shall take into consideration all or\nany of the following factors in determining whether an agreement has an appreciable\nadverse effect on competition under Section 3.\nTwo AAEC factors used by the CCI have been modified to widen the scope, including\n\"foreclosure of competition by hindering entry into the market\" to \"foreclosure of\ncompetition\" and \"accrual of benefits\" to \"accrual of benefits or harm.\"\n4. Additions to penalties in Competition law:\nThe Competition Amendment Bill 2023 introduces changes to penalties in competition\nlaw. The Bill allows the CCI to impose a penalty of up to 10% of the average income or\nturnover for the last three preceding financial years for anti-competitive agreements and\nabuse of dominant position. The penalty will be based on global turnover rather than just\ndomestic turnover. In addition, the maximum penalty for combination misrepresentation\nhas increased from ₹1 crore to ₹5 Crores.\nThe proposed amendment could have significant implications for large conglomerates\nwith diverse business operations, as a breach of competition laws by a small division in\nIndia could result in massive penalty exposure based on the conglomerate's global\nturnover. This proposal conflicts with the Supreme Court's judgment in Excel Crop Care1,\nwhich held that only the turnover derived from the business in which the contravention\nhas been found should be considered for the calculation of penalties. Overall, this\nproposed amendment is unexpected and could have significant implications for\nbusinesses operating in India.\n1 Excel Crop Care Ltd. v. Competition Commission of India, (2017) 8 SCC 47\n85. A new settlements framework and changes to how appeals work:\nThe Bill introduces a new settlements framework that allows entities to propose a\nsettlement or commitments for alleged contraventions. If accepted, this framework can\nprovide an incentive for companies to settle with CCI rather than go to court. Finally, the\nappellate tribunal will not entertain an appeal unless the company deposits 25% of the\npenalty imposed by CCI, which is expected to prompt companies to scrutinize their\ndecision to appeal.\n6. Change in the composition and functioning of the Competition Commission of\nIndia:\nPreviously, the members of the selection committee did not have the expertise of\ntechnology as a requirement at all, rather, knowledge and experience of international\ntrade, economics, business, commerce, law, finance, accountancy, management,\nindustry, public affairs or competition matters, including competition law and policy was\nconsidered sufficient to be a part of the selection committee.\nThe 2023 Bill makes the following requisites mandatory:\na. Members of the selection committee must now have knowledge of and\nexperience in technology, and CCI members must have experience in the field\nof technology.\nb. If the Commission believes that further investigation is needed, it can direct\nthe Director General to conduct further investigations and submit a\nsupplementary report. Additionally, the Chairperson and Members of the\nCommission cannot be employed by any enterprise that is or has been a party\nto a CCI proceeding for two years after leaving office.\nc. The bill also allows CCI to enter into a memorandum of arrangement with other\ngovernment departments or statutory bodies. Statutory authorities may now\nmake a reference to the Commission on any issue related to promoting the\nobjectives of the Act.\nd. CCI may also make a reference to another statutory authority on issues\ninvolving provisions of an Act whose implementation is entrusted to that\nstatutory authority.\n7. Changes to the role and responsibilities of the Director General:\nPresently, the CCI can appoint the Director General with prior approval of the Central\nGovernment, which is a change from the earlier provision where the power solely rested\nwith the Central Government. The earlier provision had been criticized for giving too\nmuch power to the CCI, which could potentially make it biased.\nSignificant Proposal in virtue of the advent of Digitization:\nThe Digital Competition Act:\n9The Digital Competition Act is an important component of the new Competition\nAmendment Bill 2023 in India. The Act aims to regulate the digital economy by\naddressing issues related to anti-competitive practices, abuse of dominance, and\nmergers and acquisitions that may negatively impact competition in the digital\nmarketplace.\nThe Act also includes provisions aimed at promoting innovation and competition in the\ndigital space, including measures to support start-ups and other small players. For\nexample, the Act proposes the creation of a Digital Innovation Fund, which will provide\nfinancial support to innovative new companies in the digital space.\nThe new Digital Competition Act, which is currently under review by the India Committee\non Digital Competition Law (CDCL), could have a significant impact on the digital\neconomy in India. The Act is aimed at promoting competition and ensuring a level playing\nfield for all players in the digital space, from start-ups to large corporations.\nThe CDCL has been tasked with reviewing and recommending changes to the Act, which\ncovers a wide range of issues, including anti-competitive behavior, data privacy, and\nconsumer protection. The Act is also expected to address issues related to the\nconcentration of power in the hands of a few dominant players in the digital space, which\nhas been a growing concern in India.\nOne of the key provisions of the Act is the establishment of a new regulator, the Digital\nMarkets Commission (DMC), which will be responsible for enforcing the provisions of the\nAct and ensuring that digital markets are open, transparent, and competitive. The DMC\nwill have the power to investigate and penalize companies that engage in anti-\ncompetitive behaviour, and to impose fines and other sanctions if necessary. The DMU\nwill also be tasked with monitoring the conduct of digital platforms and regulating their\noperations to prevent market distortion and ensure a level playing field for all players.\nOne of the key objectives of the Digital Competition Act is to prevent the dominance of a\nfew players in the digital marketplace. It seeks to ensure that smaller players have equal\nopportunities to compete and grow in the digital ecosystem. The Act proposes to\nintroduce new criteria for assessing market power in the digital sector, taking into account\nfactors such as network effects, data advantage, and access to capital.\nThe Digital Competition Act is also significant in the context of the growing concerns\naround data privacy and protection. The Act proposes to establish a Data Protection\nAuthority (DPA) to oversee the collection, processing, and use of personal data by digital\nplatforms. The DPA will have the power to investigate and take action against any\nviolations of data protection regulations.\nOverall, the new Digital Competition Act has the potential to significantly impact the\ndigital economy in India, promoting competition and ensuring a level playing field for all\nplayers in the market. By establishing a new regulator and introducing measures aimed\nat promoting innovation and competition, the Act could help to create a more dynamic\n10and competitive digital ecosystem in India, benefiting consumers, businesses, and the\nbroader economy.\nIn conclusion, the Digital Competition Act is an essential component of the Competition\nAmendment Bill 2023, which aims to promote fair competition and prevent anti-\ncompetitive practices in the digital marketplace. The Act seeks to regulate the digital\neconomy, prevent market distortion, and ensure a level playing field for all players. It is\nan important step towards creating a more transparent and competitive digital ecosystem\nin India.\nThe Way Forward:\nThe changes proposed by the Amendment Bill are expected to bring about significant\nchanges to the regulatory framework governing competition law in India. These changes\nare aimed at promoting fair competition, protecting the interests of consumers, and\npreventing anti-competitive practices. With the rapid growth of the Indian economy and\nthe increasing importance of the digital economy, it is essential to have a robust and\neffective competition law framework to ensure a fair functioning of the market, beneficial\nto all players within.\nThe Bill seeks to streamline the merger control process, introduce new settlement and\nleniency mechanisms, and empower the CCI to investigate cartels independently. The\nproposed amendments are expected to reduce the burden on the CCI, expedite the\nprocess of adjudication, and enhance the efficiency of the competition regime in India.\nHowever, at the same time, the decision to make \"global turnover\" the basis for penalty\ncalculation could be perceived as unexpected mainly because it contradicts the values\nupheld by the Supreme Court's Excel Crop Care ruling. The extended scope of cartel\nprosecution is yet another element of surprise that may be found in the proposed\namendment. The new measure expands the definition of cartelization to include hybrid\nanti-competitive agreements. This makes it possible for the CCI to treat active cartel\nparticipants and facilitators equally. Additionally, the amendment adds elements of\n\"mens rea\" to cartel prosecution, meaning that if someone \"intends to participate\" in a\ncartel, they may be penalized. Moreover, failure to file a leniency application or merely\nknowing of a cartel without knowing whether it is legal should not be taken as evidence\nof \"intention to participate.\"\nIt is true that while creating legislation, legislators frequently have the best of intentions.\nLike in this instance, the legislator's main motivation for enacting the additional rules may\nbe to discourage huge firms from engaging in anti-competitive behaviour. The possible\neffects of such policies on firms and the economy as a whole must be carefully\nconsidered, though. The 2023 Bill may be equally beneficial for the economy as it can\nbe attacking. It is yet to be seen as to what will be its impact on all its stakeholders.\n-§-\n11"}

BACKGROUND\nA Division Bench of the Hon’ble Supreme Court comprising of Hon’ble Mr. Justice\nAniruddha Bose and Hon’ble Mr. Justice J.B. Pardiwala on September 01, 20222\nupheld the orders passed by the High Court of Judicature at Bombay whereby an\napplication for amendment of pleadings under Order VI Rule 17 of the Code of Civil\nProcedure, 1908 (“CPC”) filed by the Respondent was allowed. While deciding the\nappeal, the Supreme Court summarised the guiding principles for deciding an\napplication under Order VI Rule 17, CPC.\nII. FACTS AND APPEAL\nThe parties to the appeal before the Hon’ble Supreme Court were involved in a suit\nfor specific performance of an agreement dated June 08, 1979 and a claim for\ndamages. During the pendency of the suit, the Plaintiff filed an application for\namendment of the suit for revising the claim of damages from Rs. 1,01,00,000/-\n(Rupees One Crore and One Lakh) to Rs. 4,00,01,00,000/- (Rupees Four Hundred\nCrore & One Lakh only). The amendment was allowed by the learned single judge.\nThe Defendant appealed against this order; however, the Hon’ble Division Bench of\nthe High Court of Judicature at Bombay affirmed the order. Aggrieved, the\nDefendant/Appellant approached the Hon’ble Supreme Court.\nIt was contended by the Defendant/Appellant before the Hon’ble Supreme Court that\nthe amendment was filed after a period of thirty-one years, but the Hon’ble Supreme\nCourt dismissed the appeal\nIII. OBSERVATIONS OF THE HON’BLE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA\nGeneral Rule\nThe Hon’ble Supreme Court concluded that the latter part of Order VI Rule 17, CPC\nuses the word \"shall\" which is mandatory. Hence, all amendments are to be allowed\n1 The author is an associate partner in the dispute resolution and arbitration team of the Firm’s Delhi office.\n2 Life Insurance Corporation of India Vs. Sanjeev Builders Private Limited and Another [2022 SCC Online SC 1128].\nPage 1 of 3which are necessary for determining the real question in controversy provided it does\nnot cause injustice or prejudice to the other side.\nGuiding principles for deciding an application for amendment of pleading under\nOrder VI Rule 17\nFollowing the law laid down in a catena of judicial precedents, the Hon’ble Supreme\nCourt laid down certain guiding principles. The prayer for amendment is to be allowed:\n(i) if the amendment is required for effective and proper adjudication of the\ncontroversy between the parties, and\n(ii) to avoid multiplicity of proceedings, provided\n(a) the amendment does not result in injustice to the other side,\n(b) by the amendment, the parties seeking amendment does not seek to withdraw\nany clear admission made by the party which confers a right on the other side\nand\n(c) the amendment does not raise a time barred claim, resulting in divesting of\nthe other side of a valuable accrued right (in certain situations).\n(iii) A prayer for amendment is generally required to be allowed unless:\na. by the amendment, a time barred claim is sought to be introduced, in which\ncase the fact that the claim would be time barred becomes a relevant factor\nfor consideration,\nb. the amendment changes the nature of the suit,\nc. the prayer for amendment is mala-fide, or\nd. by the amendment, the other side loses a valid defence.\ne. In dealing with a prayer for amendment of pleadings, the court should avoid a\nhyper-technical approach, and is ordinarily required to be liberal especially\nwhere the opposite party can be compensated by costs.\nf. Where the amendment would enable the court to pin-pointedly consider the\ndispute and would aid in rendering a more satisfactory decision, the prayer for\namendment should be allowed.\ng. Where the amendment merely sought to introduce an additional or a new\napproach without introducing a time barred cause of action, the amendment\nis liable to be allowed even after expiry of limitation.\nh. Amendment may be justifiably allowed where it is intended to rectify the\nabsence of material particulars in the plaint.\ni. Delay in applying for amendment alone is not a ground to disallow the prayer,\nWhere the aspect of delay is arguable, the prayer for amendment could be\nallowed and the issue of limitation framed separately for decision.\nj. Where the amendment changes the nature of the suit or the cause of action,\nso as to set up an entirely new case, foreign to the case set up in the plaint,\nthe amendment must be disallowed. Where, however, the amendment sought\nis only with respect to the relief in the plaint, and is predicated on facts which\nare already pleaded in the plaint, ordinarily the amendment is required to be\nallowed.\nk. Where the amendment is sought before commencement of trial, the court is\nrequired to be liberal in its approach. The court is required to bear in mind the\nfact that the opposite party would have a chance to meet the case set up in\namendment. As such, where the amendment does not result in irreparable\nprejudice to the opposite party, or divest the opposite party of an advantage\nwhich it had secured as a result of an admission by the party seeking\namendment, the amendment is required to be allowed. Equally, where the\nPage 2 of 3amendment is necessary for the court to effectively adjudicate on the main\nissues in controversy between the parties, the amendment should be allowed.\nIV. CONCLUSION\nThere is no straight jacketed formula for allowing an application for amendment of\npleadings. However, the courts can take aid of the above principles, analyse the facts\nof the case meticulously, circumstances leading to filing the application and whether\nany prejudice will be caused to the opposite party. The courts are expected to balance\nthe scales of justice and if a party can be compensated with cost, the amendment is\nto be allowed.\n---\nPage 3 of 3"}

Once approved, the auctioneer then seeks counter-\nproposals against the original bidder’s proposal and chooses the best amongst all options including\nthe original Bid. The original builder in most cases is granted the right to first refusal. If the original\nbidder match its offer to the challenging proposal, the Bid is awarded to him, else it is awarded to\nthe challenging bidder1.\nJudicial recognition of SCM in India-\nIn 2009, the Supreme Court decided on a challenge2 made by Ravi Development and Maharashtra\nHousing and Area Development Authority (“Ravi Development”) against a common order of the\nHigh Court of Bombay whereby the tender and conferring preferential treatment by use of SCM to\nRavi Development was deemed to be unfair, unreasonable, arbitrary and illegal. In this case, the\nSupreme court while holding that the contract offered in favour of Ravi Development was correct,\nclarified that the decision to apply the mode of SCM clearly fell within the realm of the executive\ndiscretion and that there was due application of mind by the Housing and Area Development\nauthority, and hence did not foul of Article 14 of the Constitution of India. Further, in the said\njudgment the Supreme Court also suggested steps that may be kept in mind to avoid ill effects of\nSCM and encourage transparency and proper execution of the scheme. Since then, many states/\nauthorities have with time also adopted their own guidelines for SCM.3\nAdvent of SCM under the Indian insolvency regime\nOn August 27, 2021, the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India’s (“IBBI”) published a discussion\npaper (“Discussion Paper”), whereunder amongst others, the use of SCM was suggested to tackle\nthe issue of delay in passing of resolution plans.\nThe Discussion Paper observed that while Regulation 39 of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board\nof India (Insolvency Resolution Process for Corporate Persons) Regulations, 2016 (“CIRP\nRegulations”) provides the mechanism for approval of resolution plan by the Committee of Creditors\n(“CoC”), and sub-regulation 3(a) thereof provides that CoC shall evaluate the resolution plans\n1 https://ibbi.gov.in/Discussionpaper-CIRP-27Aug2021.pdf.\n2 Ravi Development vs Shree Krishna Prathisthan & Ors.

Here it is important to keep in mind that till June\n2021, SCM was being implemented during the CIRP where the CoC was in agreement of its\nimplementation. However, if we look at the CIRPs where the same was implemented, owing to lack\nof defined guidelines for implementation of the same, there were several objections that were\npreferred by stakeholders during the CIRP, thus causing a delay which was unavoidable. It is also\nimportant to note that in the past, the risks of lack of transparency, favouritism and adequate\ncompetition along with absence of symmetry in the bidding process, did cause speculations against\nSCM. However, with the amendment to the CIRP Regulations, the prospective resolution applicants\ncan at least be aware beforehand that a challenge procedure is envisaged, if at all, under the RFRP\nfor improvement of their plans.\nOne question however which begs an answer is, can a resolution professional use the SCM or any\nother challenge procedure if the RFRP for a corporate debtor does not explicitly provide for the\nsame. Considering the number of precedents upholding the commercial wisdom of CoC, one would\nlike to believe that if in the opinion of CoC and resolution professionals, the best outcome of the\n4 National Company Law Tribunal/ National Company Law Appellate Tribunal\n5 Saket Tex Dye Private Limited v.

In other words, even if possible use of SCM\nis not mentioned in the RFRP, if the CoC considers it appropriate to use SCM where there is enough\ntime and a transparent process is followed, the said process should be allowed to achieve the\nmaximization of assets of the corporate debtor. However, owing to the statutory requirement under\nRegulation 39(1A)(b) to stipulate the possibility of using such challenge procedure in the RFRP itself,\nit will have to be seen if the Tribunals will go by a strict interpretation or will allow use of SCM de\nhors such stipulation, by deferring to the commercial wisdom of the CoC.\n-§-\n3"}
{"Title": null, "Publication_Date": "30 December 2022", "URL": "https://kochhar.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Technology-Law-Updates-DPDP-Bill-2022.pdf", "Content": "Technology Law Advisory – Digital Personal\nData Protection Bill, 2022\nINTRODUCTION\nOn November 18, 2022, the Government of India released the long awaited fourth draft of India’s\nproposed privacy law, now renamed as the Digital Personal Data Protection Bill (“Bill”). The\nGovernment has sought for feedback on the draft Bill by December 17, 2022.\nAt first glance, the Bill is quite a surprise – it is a completely new draft and not a redraft of the previous\nversions of the Bill and is much shorter and simpler. It departs substantially from the GDPR model of\nprivacy laws that is quite commonplace today.\nAPPLICABILITY\nThe law applies only to personal data that is collected online or which is collected offline, but which is\ndigitized. The law will apply to processing of personal data outside India if such processing is in\nconnection with any profiling of principals in India or activity of offering goods or services within the\nterritory of India. The law also exempts processing of data in India of persons located outside India\nunder a cross border contractual arrangement - this essentially covers the offshore/outsourcing\nindustry.\nDEFINITIONS\nThe Bill uses similar nomenclature as the previous versions. A data subject is referred to as a data\nprincipal and a data controller is referred to as a data fiduciary. There is no concept or definition of\nsensitive personal data. The DPA is referred to as the Data Protection Board of India (“DPBI”).\nGROUNDS FOR COLLECTION AND PROCESSING\nConsent continues to be the main ground for processing of personal data. It must be “freely given”,\n“’specific”, “informed” and an “unambiguous indication of consent” through a “clear affirmative action”.\nIt seems clear that explicit consent would be required. Consent can also be withdrawn, the\nconsequences of which would be borne by the data subject.\nThe draft Bill also includes obvious grounds for processing of personal data such as compliance with\nlaws and court orders, actions dealing with epidemics or law & order situations.\nThe concept of legitimate interest appears to be captured in different ways. Several situations are\nmentioned whereby consent is deemed to have been given. These include processing of personal\ndata “in public interest” including to prevent or detect fraud, for network and information security, credit\nscoring, processing of publicly available personal data and for recovery of debt. It seems unclear though\nwhether private enterprises can use these grounds given that the processing needs to be “in public\ninterest”. There is also the ground of “fair and reasonable purpose” but in this case, the government\nhas to notify what is a fair and reasonable purpose. In this regard, the law prescribes that the\ngovernment can consider legitimate interests of the data fiduciary.\nOne key ground is where processing of personal data is “necessary” and where personal data is\nprovided voluntarily and “it is reasonably expected that the data subject would provide such personal\ndata”. One would have to show that the processing is “necessary” and the personal data was provided\n“voluntarily” and the data principal would reasonably be expected to provide such data. On wonders\nwhether this provision could have been drafted better, assuming this is intended to be a legitimateinterest type of ground. It will likely become the most important provision of the new statute for\nbusinesses that do not wish to go down the consent route.\nNOTICE\nThe previous versions of the Bill provided for extensive information to be provided as part of notice to\ndata principals. That was hugely an overkill. This version covers only two things – the types of personal\ndata to be processed and the purposes of processing. This information has to be provided in an\nitemized manner.\nAPPLICABILITY TO CHILDREN\nThe draft Bill keeps the threshold for children at 18 years. This will be seen as a disappointment for\nthe online world as global standards tend to be closer to 16 years. Verifiable parental consent is\nrequired for collection of personal data of children. Further, the Bill prohibits profiling of children or\nbehavioral monitoring or targeted advertising to children. However, the Government has the power to\nexempt these requirements through notification.\nRIGHTS AND DUTIES OF DATA PRINCIPALS\nThere are several rights of data principals. This includes the right to know what personal data is being\nprocessed and the right to have inaccurate personal data corrected. A data principal can also ask for\npersonal data to be deleted on the ground that its storage no longer serves the purpose for which it\nwas collected. Interestingly, the Bill includes duties of data principals. This pertains essentially to a\nduty not to provide false information and not to lodge frivolous or false grievances.\nSTORAGE OF PERSONAL DATA\nThe draft law requires the data fiduciary to ensure that personal data maintained is accurate and to use\nappropriate organizational and technical measures to comply with the law. Data fiduciaries must also\nuse reasonable security measures to prevent data breaches. A data fiduciary may maintain personal\ndata only as long as it serves the purpose for which it was collected or for a legal or business purpose.\nThereafter, the personal data needs to be deleted.\nPERSONAL DATA BREACH\nThe draft Bill defines a ‘personal data breach’ to mean any unauthorized processing or accidental\ndisclosure, use, alteration, or destruction of personal data, that compromises its confidentiality, integrity,\nor availability. In case of personal data breach, the data fiduciary or data principal must inform both the\nDPBI as well as the affected data principal, in a manner prescribed by the government. The broad\ndefinition of a personal data breach would cover small instances of data breaches for which notification\nto the government and data principals seems quite onerous.\nSIGNIFICANT DATA FIDUCIARY\nThe draft law retains the concept of a Significant Data Fiduciary (“SDF”). This is a data fiduciary that\nfulfills the criteria set forth by the government. In determining who would be an SDF, the government\nwould consider factors such as volume of data and risk of harm. Interestingly, such factors also include\n“potential impact on the integrity and sovereignty of India” and “risk to electoral democracy”. SDF’s are\nrequired to appoint Data Protection Officers, who must report to the Board of the company. Further,\nthey have to appoint an independent data auditor to audit compliance with the privacy law. The\nGovernment can also notify when SDF’s have to conduct privacy impact assessments.\nDATA PROTECTION OFFICER\nOnly a SDF is required to appoint a Data Protection Officer. However, every data fiduciary must appoint\na person to act as the point of contact for anyone who wants to file a grievance. The contact details of\nthe grievance officer needs to be published.DATA LOCALIZATION AND DATA TRANSFERS\nThe draft Bill does not directly include provisions on data localization. Gone is the requirement that\ncritical personal data needs to be stored only in India or that sensitive personal data can be transferred\noutside India but a copy must be retained in India. The Bill states that the Government would notify\ncountries to which personal data can be transferred. It would appear that until the Government notifies\nthese countries, personal data can be freely transferred outside India though perhaps the notification\nwill be issued at the time the law comes into force. The law is absent on other means of allowing data\ntransfers such as through standard contractual clauses – this is after all the method by which personal\ndata is transferred from the EU to India.\nEXEMPTION TO GOVERNMENT\nThe Bill grants the power to the Government to exempt itself and its agencies from any requirement of\nthe Bill. The grounds mentioned, such as sovereignty and integrity of India, security of state, etc., are\ntaken from the Constitution of India and also cited by the Supreme Court of India as grounds on which\nprivacy rights can be restricted. These grounds are however quite broad and proportionality and\nreasonableness are not essential ingredients.\nPENALTIES\nThe draft new law prescribes penalties for non-compliance. There is a schedule which mentions\npenalty caps for specific violations. For example, failure to take reasonable security safeguards to\nprevent personal data breach would involve a penalty of up to Rs 25 million (approx. USD 30 million).\nPenalties in general can go up to Rs 50 million (approx. USD 60 million). Interestingly, there is no\nprovision for awarding compensation to affected data subjects.\nANALYSIS\nIn concept, the Government has taken a decidedly Indian approach to drafting this legislation. It is far\nsimpler than past versions and goes against the current trend of the GDPR model of privacy legislation.\nThis type of legislation is quite appropriate for India given its huge unorganized and SME sector and\ngiven that standards of privacy compliance are quite low in India. It probably does mean though that\nthe legislation will fail to obtain an adequacy ruling from the EU. In any case, due to not having\nindependent oversight over government surveillance, Indian law does not fully comply with Schrems II.\nThere are however a host of issues that need to be dealt with in the law. Most important is to clarify\nthe language surrounding the legitimate interest type of ground which we believe is at the heart of\nprivacy legislation. Is the concept of necessity sufficient to deal with legitimate situations of collection\nand processing of personal data? It would also appear that notice requirements apply only when\nconsent is being obtained. This means that when personal data is being processed under other\ngrounds, that fall under deemed consent provisions, no notice is required. The need to prescribe\nconsent is itself debatable. Consent has been found to not really be a means of protection to data\nsubjects especially since in most cases, data subjects have no choice but to give consent.\nOne recommended approach has all along been to have a light touch legislation and to allow the DPA\nto build further regulation slowly through delegated legislation. This draft legislation partially follows that\napproach. While the DPBI does have powers to pass regulations, this relates only to carrying out the\nprovisions of the law. It is debatable whether it has powers to pass regulation on matters not mentioned\nin the law. For example, issues such as data portability, privacy by design, etc., find no place in the\nBill. It would have been better for the powers given to the DPBI to have been spelled out in greater\ndetail.\nThe blanket ban on tracking of children’s activity on the internet and behavioral advertising seems\nsomewhat unreasonable. How would an online video or music channel for example recommend\nmovies or music to children based on their tastes without tracking their activity?The Bill also gives the government the power to exempt any of its instrumentalities from any of the\nprovisions of the law. There is no reasonableness or proportionality threshold mentioned. Perhaps it\ncan be read into the law given pronouncements already made by the Supreme Court of India. The\nblanket exemption to the Government on the need to delete data that no longer serves the purpose for\nwhich it was collected is also unfortunate. It is also unfortunate that the composition of the DPBI has\nnot been prescribed in the law thereby leaving it to the Government to appoint whoever they want. A\ntech savvy and nimble DPA is very much required in order to manage data privacy regulation in India\nespecially given that some of the requirements of the law will be “as may be prescribed” later.\nOverall, the approach adopted makes sense given the Indian environment and can be a launching pad\nfor more extensive privacy related regulation in the future. There are obviously gaps and drafting errors\nbut that must be expected in a simpler legislation that also strikes a new path and is drafted by people\nwho are not privacy experts. It is hoped that the Government will work with the privacy community to\niron out these issues and take this document to enactment.\nXXXABOUT KOCHHAR & CO\nKochhar & Co is a leading full service commercial law firm with a national presence in India.

{"Title": "Electronic Evidence – Revisiting the Basics", "Publication_Date": "22 February 2023", "URL": "https://kochhar.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Kochhar-Co.-Delhi.-Article-by-Samiron-Borkataky-Kritika-Angirish-Electronic-Evidence-Revisiting-the-Basics-Feb-2023-.pdf", "Content": "Electronic Evidence – Revisiting the Basics\nBy Samiron Borkataky and Kritika Angirish February 2023\nIntroduction\nIn order to prove a fact vide a document, one may rely on the original document, a\ncarbon copy, print-out, or a public record, etc., thereby either placing reliance over\nprimary or secondary evidence. For documentary evidence, in contrast to oral\nevidence, before placing reliance on the same, the court looks at the said evidence\nin the sequence of relevancy, admissibility, and proof. Generally, admissibility\ndepends on relevancy.1 However, in the case of electronic records2, which is also\na “document” admissible as evidence after amendments to the Indian Evidence Act,\n1872 (“Evidence Act”) read with sections 2(o) and 2(t) of the Information &\nTechnology Act, 2000 (“IT Act”); admissibility precedes relevancy. This and other\naspects in relation to electronic evidence is dealt with under the provisions of\nsections 65A and 65B of the Evidence Act, which has been held to be a complete\ncode in itself by the Supreme Court in Arjun Panditrao Khotkar vs. Kailash\nKushanrao Gorantyal and Ors3.\nThis write-up touches upon certain basic principles that may kept in mind when a\nparty seeks to rely on electronic evidence.\nRelevancy of Electronic Records\nSection 5 of the Evidence Act provides that evidence can only be given regarding\nfacts in issue or when relevant. Further, whoever desires any court to give judgment\nas to a legal right on the existence of a fact which she/he asserts, has to prove the\nexistence of that fact. Accordingly, as per\nsection 136 of the Evidence Act, relevancy must be established before\nadmissibility can be dealt with.4 However, as per sections 65A and 65B of the\nEvidence Act, when read together, the said sections only deal with proof and\nadmissibility of electronic evidence, and not the aspect of relevancy of such\nevidence. Thus, it is noticed that the relevancy of electronic evidence is determined\nonly after determining the issue of admissibility of such evidence (i.e., after\nsubmission of a certificate under section 65B of the Evidence Act).\n1 Section 136 of the Evidence Act.\n2 Section 2(o) of the Information Technology Act, 2000.\n3 (2020) 7 SCC 1 | Civil Appeal Nos. 20825 – 20826 of 2017.\n4 Ref to Fn 3 ( see Para 2 of judgment written by Justice V Ramasubramanian).\n1Admissibility of Electronic Records\nSection 65B clearly differentiates between the original information contained in the\ncomputer itself and copies made therefrom. However, despite the same, copies of\nthe electronic record are treated at par as primary evidence for admissibility once\nthe compliance envisaged under section 65B of the Evidence Act is undertaken.\nTherefore, section 65B of the Evidence Act makes it clear that when it comes to\ninformation as specified in Section 65B(1) of the Evidence Act, admissibility and\nproof thereof must follow the drill of Section 65B, which is a special provision in this\nbehalf, thereby making Sections 62 to 65 of the Evidence Act redundant for this\npurpose.5\nIt can thus be concluded that section 65B of the Evidence Act place\nadmissibility as the first or the outermost check-post, whereunder the certificate\nrequired under 65B (4) of the Evidence Act is a condition precedent to the\nadmissibility of electronic evidence.\nHowever, it is worth mentioning that if primary evidence is placed before the court,\nwhich may be a laptop, mobile phone, tape recorder, etc. (containing the electronic\nevidence), the same is admissible in evidence, without compliance with the\nconditions in section 65B of the Evidence Act.6\nProving contents of Electronic Records\nSection 65A of the Evidence Act states that for the purposes of proving the\nelectronic record the procedure envisaged under Section 65B of the Evidence Act\nmust be followed. However, on a reading of section 65B of the Evidence Act, it\nappears that the section only limits itself to the admissibility of the electronic\nevidence itself (and not its contents) without having to prove the same by relying\nupon the primary/ original record/ evidence.\nThe aforesaid ambiguity is removed on a reading of section 22A of the Evidence\nAct which provides that “oral admissions as to the contents of electronic records\nare not relevant, unless the genuineness of the electronic record produced is in\nquestion”. Therefore, on a conjoint of reading of sections 22A and 65B of the\nEvidence Act, it becomes clear that unless the genuineness of the electronic\nevidence is challenged, it passes the test of admissibility of both ‘form’ and of\n‘content’ by following the procedure mandated under the section 65B of the\nEvidence Act.\nSection 65B of the Evidence Act is thus an exception to the Best Evidence Rule7,\nwhere the only requirement is that the contents of the output must be authentic and\nthere should be reason to believe that they are authentic. Where, however, the\ngenuineness is questioned, oral evidence has to be led, and in some cases, expert\nevidence may also be led in terms of section 45A of the Evidence Act for proof of\nthe said document.\n5 Anvar P.V. vs. P.K. Basheer & Ors | (2014) 10 SCC 473.\n6 Ibid Fn 5\n7 The Best Evidence Rule is a rule in law according to which when evidence such as a document or recording is presented,\nonly the original will be accepted unless there is a legitimate reason that the original cannot be used.\n2Who can give a certificate under Section 65B (4) of the Evidence\nAct\nThe person who gives a certificate can be anyone out of several persons who\noccupy a ‘responsible official position’ in relation to the operation of the relevant\ndevice (from where the electronic evidence is obtained), as also the person who\nmay otherwise be in the ‘management of relevant activities’.\nConsidering that such a certificate may also be given long after the electronic\nevidence has actually been produced by the computer, it is stated that the person\ngiving the requisite certificate can do so based on his belief and not necessarily his\nknowledge. This is since, the Courts have held that the word “and” used in the\nexpression “best of his knowledge and belief” in Section 65B(4) of the Evidence Act\nmust be read as “or”.8\nFurther, where the person having a ‘responsible official position’ is not producing\nthe certificate in terms of Section 65B of the Evidence Act, one can also apply to\nthe court under its powers to call for production of the same. Once such application\nis made to the Court, the Court then orders or directs that the requisite certificate\nbe produced by such person. In case, the party who has relied on electronic\nevidence and ought to have provided a certificate, has done all that she/he can\npossibly do to obtain the requisite certificate but is unable to do so, then the\nrequirement for certificate will be relaxed in view of the principles of lex non cogit\nan impossibilia i.e., the law does not demand the impossible, and impotentia\nexcusat legem i.e., when there is a disability that makes it impossible to obey the\nlaw, the alleged disobedience of the law is excused.9\nAt what stage can you fulfil the conditions specified under\nSection 65B of the Evidence Act\nSection 65B of the Evidence Act does not speak of the stage at which such\ncertificate must be furnished to the Court. In Anvar P.V. vs. P.K. Basheer & Ors.10,\nthe Supreme Court did observe that such certificate must accompany the electronic\nrecord when the same is produced in evidence. However, the law laid down in\nParas Jain vs. State of Rajasthan11 and Kundan Singh vs. State12 was upheld in the\ncase of Arjun Panditrao’s case (supra) where it was observed that as long as the\nhearing in a trial13 is not over, the requisite certificate can be directed to be produced\nby the judge at any stage, so that information contained in the electronic form can\nthen be admitted and relied upon as evidence. Further, in Arjun Panditrao’s case\n(supra), it was clarified that in cases where either a defective certificate is given, or\nin cases where such certificate has been demanded and is not given by the\nconcerned person, the Judge conducting the trial must summon the person/persons\nreferred to in section 65B(4) of the Evidence Act and require that such certificate\nbe given by such person/persons; this the trial judge ought to seek at the stage\nwhen the electronic record is produced in evidence before him without the requisite\ncertificate.\n8 Ref to Fn 3 in Para 58.\n9 Ref to Fn 3 in Para 49.\n10 (2014) 10 SCC 473.\n11 2015 SCC OnLine Raj 8331.\n12 2015 SCC OnLine Del 13647.\n13 The stage of admitting documentary evidence in a criminal trial is the filing of the charge-sheet (see Fn 3).\n3Additionally, it has to be borne in mind, that if a certificate is being submitted post\nthe filing of the electronic record, the party submitting the certificate ought to satisfy\nto the court the reasons for such delayed submission. It is to be noted that such a\nparty is not immune to the risk of her/his certificate not being taken on record\nthereby resulting in a situation that the electronic record, though filed at the\nappropriate time, is not read in evidence.14 Depending on the facts of each case,\nthe discretion of the Court is exercised keeping in mind the importance of a fair trial,\nbona fides of the party, and the prejudice that may be caused to the concerned\nparty.\nK&Co. Observations\nWhile the main emphasis of this article is on the basic principles to be noted when\na party seeks to rely on electronic evidence, before parting, it would be worthwhile\nto reflect on one practical aspect concerning leading of electronic evidence. This is\nregarding the absolute reliance on a certificate under section 65B of the Evidence\nAct, particularly in cases of video and audio evidence. Even though, at first brush,\nit appears that the law on proving electronic evidence is settled, however, in reality\nwhen it comes to proving electronic evidence, it is seen that the courts often insist\non the production of primary evidence, i.e., the electronic device itself, rather than\nrelying on a certificate under section 65B of the Evidence Act and the provisions of\nsection 22A and 45A of the said Act in support thereof. This however appears to be\nnot owing to a rigid mindset but due to the practical difficulty faced by the courts to\ndetermine the genuineness of the electronic record when questioned. Accordingly,\neven though a party relying on the contents of an electronic record ought to be able\nto prove their case by simply providing a certificate under section 65B (4) of the\nEvidence Act and leading oral or expert evidence in support thereof, however, that\nmay not always be the case.\n-§-\n14 Eli Lilly And Company & Anr vs. Maiden Pharmaceuticals Limited (CS(COMM) 1472/2016).\n4"}

Chennai\nEmail: ram@chennai.kochhar.com November 2022\n“In view of the associated risks, it has been decided that, with immediate effect, entities\nregulated by the Reserve Bank shall not deal in VCs or provide services for facilitating\nany person or entity in dealing with or settling VCs. Such services include maintaining\naccounts, registering, trading, settling, clearing, giving loans against virtual tokens,\naccepting them as collateral, opening accounts of exchanges dealing with them and\ntransfer / receipt of money in accounts relating to purchase/ sale of VCs.\nRegulated entities which already provide such services shall exit the relationship within\nthree months from the date of this circular.\nThese instructions are issued in exercise of powers conferred by section 35A read with\nsection 36(1)(a) of Banking Regulation Act, 1949, section 35A read with section 36(1)(a)\nand section 56 of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, section 45JA and 45L of the\nReserve Bank of India Act, 1934 and Section 10(2) read with Section 18 of Payment and\nSettlement Systems Act, 2007.”\nThe above circular dated April 06, 2018, issued by the Reserve Bank of India, prohibited\nthe dealing of Virtual Currencies in India. This circular was then set aside by Hon’ble\nJustice V Ramasubramanian vide his elaborate and interesting judgment dated March\n04, 2020. It was held that:\n“…While we have recognized elsewhere in this order, the power of RBI to take a pre-\nemptive action, we are testing in this part of the order the proportionality of such\nmeasure, for the determination of which RBI needs to show at least some semblance of\nany damage suffered by its regulated entities. But there is none. When the consistent\nstand of RBI is that they have not banned VCs and when the Government of India is\nunable to take a call despite several committees coming up with several proposals\nincluding two draft bills, both of which advocated exactly opposite positions, it is not\npossible for us to hold that the impugned measure is proportionate.\n7.1. Therefore, in the light of the above discussion, the petitioners are entitled to succeed\nand the impugned Circular dated 06-04-2018 is liable to be set aside on the ground of\nproportionality. Accordingly, the writ petitions are allowed and the Circular dated 06- 04-\n2018 is set aside.”\n1This was an important event in the evolution of Virtual Currencies in India and a reason\nfor my own interest in the concept.\nFor those who might have followed my work, this is my third article in the NFT – Virtual\nAssets series. Now let’s explore developments from the Reserve Bank of India with\nrespect to virtual currencies and its thirst for the same.\nI. Central Bank Digital Currencies:\nRecently, the Reserve Bank of India announced that the first pilot in the Digital\nRupee - Wholesale segment i.e., the central bank digital currency (CBDC), will\ncommence from November 1, 2022.\nIn his keynote address on July 22, 2021, Mr. T. Rabi Sankar, Deputy Governor,\nReserve Bank of India, spoke about Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDC).\nCBDC was defined as “the legal tender issued by a central bank in a digital form.\nIt is the same as a fiat currency and is exchangeable one-to-one with the fiat\ncurrency. Only its form is different.”1\nBut before we discuss CBDC in detail, let’s look at the functions of Reserve Bank\nof India.\nII. Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and CBDC:\nRBI, the central bank of India, is a vital organ of the financial ecosystem of India.\nFrom their role in issuance of currency to providing to solutions for the effective\nfunctioning of the economy, the RBI shoulders great responsibility in the stability\nand advancement of the economy.\nFinancial stability and facilitating efficient payments, though has always been\namong the main objectives of the RBI, the development in technology also\npushes the RBI to adapt to such change.\nCentral Banks across the globe are engaged in exploring CBDCs and a few\ncountries have also introduced proofs of concept / pilots on CBDC. The High\nLevel Inter-Ministerial Committee (November 2017) constituted by Ministry of\nFinance, Government of India (GoI) to examine the policy and legal framework\nfor regulation of virtual / crypto currencies had recommended the introduction of\nCBDCs as a digital form of fiat money in India. Like other central banks, RBI has\nalso been exploring the pros and cons of introduction of CBDCs since quite some\ntime.2\nA survey conducted by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) in 2021\nrevealed that 86% of central banks around the globe were actively researching\n1 https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_SpeechesView.aspx?Id=1111\n2 https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_SpeechesView.aspx?Id=1111\n2the potential for CBDCs, 60% were experimenting with the technology and 14%\nwere deploying pilot projects.3\nThe popularity that the Private Virtual Currencies (PVC) enjoys among today’s\npopulation is not negligible and the RBI has certainly made itself aware of the\npotential of virtual currencies. And RBI has also queued in to have a taste of it.\nIt is however, the responsibility of the RBI to provide its citizens a risk free\nexperience with virtual currencies.\nThe RBI had set up an Internal Working Group (WG) in October 2020 to\nundertake a study on appropriate design/implementation architecture for\nintroducing CBDCs in India. The WG in their February 2021 report,\nrecommended that e₹ (Digital Rupee) be issued as another form of currency\nwhile its backed by robust legal framework. The WG was of the view that\nfinalising a model for implementation of e₹ within a short duration may not be\ndesirable and proposed to continue deliberations on CBDC over a longer period\nto refine and crystallise requirements for the implementation of other models of\ne₹ in future.4\nAn internal high-level committee on CBDC under the chairmanship of Shri Ajay\nKumar Choudhary, Executive Director, RBI was constituted in February 2022 by\nthe Reserve Bank to brainstorm and undertake an extensive study on various\naspects of CBDC and based on the deliberations in the Committee, the Reserve\nBank released a “Concept Note” in October 2022, to present its findings and\nrecommendations. In the article below, I have set out to discuss the concept note\nand my take aways from it.\nThe basic features of CBDC include:\n• CBDC is sovereign currency issued by Central Banks in alignment with their\nmonetary policy\n• It appears as a liability on the central bank’s balance sheet\n• Must be accepted as a medium of payment, legal tender, and a safe store of\nvalue by all citizens, enterprises, and government agencies.\n• Freely convertible against commercial bank money and cash\n• Fungible legal tender for which holders need not have a bank account\n• Expected to lower the cost of issuance of money and transactions5\nIII. The Need for CBDC:\nIn the keynote address dated July 22, 2021, the Deputy Governor of RBI stated\nthat, there has been an increased use of digital currency in India and that\n3 https://www.bis.org/about/bisih/topics/cbdc.htm\n4https://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/PublicationReport/Pdfs/CONCEPTNOTEACB531172E0B4DFC9A6E506C2C24FFB6.P\nDF\n5https://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/PublicationReport/Pdfs/CONCEPTNOTEACB531172E0B4DFC9A6E506C2C24FFB6.P\nDF\n3preference for cash mostly was restricted to transactions below INR 500. And\ndue to the high currency to GDP ratio in India, CBDC would be beneficial in\nreducing the cost of printing, transporting, storing and distributing currency.\nDeveloping CBDCs backed by the Government, could provide the public with\nuses that any private VC can provide and also protect the public from the\nabnormal level of volatility some of these VCs experience.\nFurther, in the keynote address delivered by Shri T Rabi Sankar, Deputy\nGovernor, Reserve Bank of India, February 14th, 2022, at the Indian Banks\nAssociation 17th Annual Banking Technology Conference and Awards6, some\nof the arguments made for regulation of cryptocurrencies in India were\nrecognized, viz:\na. Blockchain or Distributed Ledger Technology is a promising technology where\nIndians might have a global edge. Banning cryptocurrencies would affect the\nabsorption of DLT technology in India.\nb. Most major countries are not banning cryptocurrencies but are considering some\nkind of regulation.\nc. Many Indians have already invested in cryptocurrencies and banning it may lead\nto wealth loss for them.\nd. Banning in any case is unlikely to be effective because by its very nature\ncryptocurrencies can be acquired and traded in an anonymous manner.\nHowever, it has also been argued by the RBI that, private virtual currencies sit\nat substantial odds to the historical concept of money and they have no intrinsic\nvalue. It is argued that, the inherent design of cryptocurrencies is more geared\nto bypass the established and regulated intermediation and control\narrangements that play a crucial role of ensuring integrity and stability of\nmonetary and financial eco-system. Therefore, the need for CBDC.\nIV. Types of CBDC:\nAs mentioned above, the RBI announced the pilot of CBDC – Wholesale from\nNovember 1, 2022 and more recently, there have been reports that the RBI plans\nto start a trial run for retail central bank digital currency. As may be evident from\nabove, there are two types of CBDC that the RBI plans to operate – Wholesale\nand Retail.\na. Wholesale CBDC:\nWholesale CBDC are of the nature that will facilitate interbank settlements on\nnet basis. This helps in making the financial system of the country faster, safer,\nand economical. They serve the same purpose as reserves held at the central\nbank but with additional functionality. Wholesale CBDC can also facilitate cross-\nborder transactions between the wholesale CBDC systems of multiple countries,\nwhich is achieved by creating a corridor network or ‘bridge’ with an operator node\n6 https://rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_SpeechesView.aspx?Id=1196\n4run jointly by the central banks of the participating countries that issue the\ndepository receipts.7\nb. Retail CBDC:\nThis category of CBDC is meant for use by ordinary consumers to conduct their\ndaily financial transactions. Retail CBDC is based on distributed ledger\ntechnology (DLT), like a private blockchain network handled by the government\nwhich helps it to trace transactions while maintaining anonymity. Retail CBDC\nwould be targeted for use by all private sector, non-financial consumers, and\nbusinesses. It is basically an electronic version of cash held in hand for our day-\nto-day retail consumption. CBDC can provide an alternative medium of making\ndigital payments in case of operational and/or technical problems leading to\ndisruption in other payment system infrastructures.\nA detailed study of the wholesale and retail types of CBDC, might warrant\nintroduction of both types by the RBI. But how?\nV. Models of Issuance:\nIt is first essential to understand that, depending on the model adopted, the\nwhole ecosystem will need various players to function, which includes the RBI,\npublic and private banks, payment service providers (PSPs) and other financial\ninstitutions and third-party service or application providers.\nThe issuance architecture of retail CBDC can be of the following types:\na. Single Tier model – Also known as the Direct CBDC Model, here, the central\nbank manages the entire CBDC system including issuance and account-\nkeeping. In this model, the central bank server is involved in all payments and\nthe central bank keeps a record of all balances and updates it with every\ntransaction. It provides an advantage of a very resilient system as every\ntransaction is backed by the central bank. It however marginalises involvement\nof private sector. Though this model might lead to disintermediation, it might\nalso be seen as a disadvantage as the central bank would then have the\nadditional responsibility of managing customers, verifications, AML checks etc.\nb. Two-Tier Model – As the name suggests, this model is designed as a two-tier\nsystem to combat the disadvantages of the Single Tier model above. In this\nmodel, the central bank and other service providers, both play a role to support\neach other. There are two models under this architecture viz. Indirect model and\nHybrid Model.\n- Indirect Model - In this model, consumers would hold their CBDC in an\naccount/wallet with a bank, or a service provider. The obligations towards the\nconsumer would be carried out by a service provider or an intermediary, rather\n7 https://www.pwc.in/industries/financial-services/fintech/dp/central-bank-digital-currency-in-the-indian-\ncontext.html#sources\n5than the central bank. The central bank would however monitor the wholesale\nbalances of CBDC of the intermediaries and ensure that they are in line with the\nretail balances.\n- Hybrid Model - In the Hybrid model, by definition, the central bank and the\nintermediaries would have a combined control on the CBDCs. The central bank\nwill issue CBDC to other entities which shall make those entities then\nresponsible for all customer-associated activities. While the intermediaries\nhandle retail payments, the central bank also maintains a central ledger of all\ntransactions and operates a backup technical infrastructure allowing it to restart\nthe payment system if intermediaries run into insolvency or technical outages.\nTherefore, under this model, though the intermediaries handle transactions,\nCBDC will be a direct claim on the central bank.\nVI. Uses and Benefits of CBDC:\nCBDC, by merely being a sovereign currency alone, has higher advantage.\nApart from bringing resilience and adding efficiency to the financial ecosystem,\nother key motivations for CBDC include reduction in operational costs involved\nin physical cash management, innovation in cross-border payments space and\nproviding public with uses that any private virtual currencies can provide, without\nthe associated risks. CBDC also helps in implementing AML and combatting\nfinancial terrorism (CFT) measures by acting as a highly secure way for cross-\nborder transactions.\ni. Reduction in cost associated with physical cash management.\nIndia continues to face significant costs on cash management. As per the\nconcept note, the total expenditure incurred on security printing during April 1,\n2021 to March 31, 2022 was ₹4,984.80 crore as against ₹4,012.10 crore in the\nprevious year (July 1, 2020 to March 31, 2021). CBDC on the other hand,\nreduces operational costs. Though establishing a CBDC infrastructure may be\nexpensive, subsequent marginal operating costs shall be very low.\nii. Supporting competition, efficiency and innovation in payments.\nThe payments systems in the country have been majorly transformed due to the\ndigital revolution. Consumers now have a wide range of options to choose for a\npayment method. RBI’s CBDC would offer the public broad access to digital\nmoney free from credit risk and liquidity risk.\niii. Cross border transactions.\nAs per the World Bank, India is the world’s largest recipient of remittances as it\nreceived $87 billion in 2021 with the United States being the biggest source,\naccounting for over 20 per cent of these funds. Therefore, misuse of\ninformal/illegal channels is a concern.\nThe G20 has also made enhancing cross-border payments a priority and\nendorsed a comprehensive programme to address the key challenges to cross\n6border payment, namely high costs, low speed, limited access and insufficient\ntransparency and frictions that contributed to these challenges. Therefore,\naddressing of challenges faced in cross-border payment is one of the major\nmotivations for exploring issuance of CBDC.\nCBDCs would ensure faster remittances and collaboration among major\neconomies of the world, would facilitate creation of necessary infrastructure for\nCBDC transfer. An infrastructure that would ensure interoperability could prove\nuseful in reducing time required for such payments.\nThough the technical architecture may not be uniform, interoperability can be\nachieved through a common bridge that is able to standardize the inputs and\noutputs from different systems in a form that is understandable to every player.\niv. Support financial inclusion.\nSome of the existing challenges to financial inclusion include limited physical\ninfrastructure - especially in remote areas, poor connectivity, non-availability of\ncustomized products, etc. CBDC may provide the public a safe sovereign digital\nmoney for meeting various transaction needs. It shall make financial services\nmore accessible. With offline functionality as an option, it will enable\ntransactions even without the internet, which translates to better access in\nregions with poor internet connectivity.\nv. Safeguard the trust of the common man in the national currency vis-à-vis\nproliferation of crypto assets.\nCrypto-assets are considered to be a threat as it may lead to creation of a\nparallel economy and will likely undermine the monetary policy transmission and\nstability of the domestic currency. RBI’s CBDC on the other hand could provide\nrisk free experiences for virtual currency users.\nvi. Retail payments.\nRetail payments are a significant motivation for CBDC. Payments between\nconsumers and business can be smoother and faster with effective\nimplementation of CBDC and the architecture required.\nvii. MSME lending.\nLending to micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) in India can be faster\nand instant, with CBDC. It can help businesses grow and survive when\navailability of cash is limited.\nviii. Programmability.\nAn interesting application of CBDC is its programmability. Which in simple terms\nwould mean, the money can be programmed to its end use. Certain currencies\ncould be programmed to be used for a specific purpose. An example cited in\nthe concept note is that an agriculture credit can be programmed to be usable\nonly at input store credits.\n7Apart from the above, CBDC also pose some risks. Below are some of the\npossible implications and other considerations that have to be addressed before\nthe issuance of CBDCs to public.\nVII. Implications and Considerations:\nIt is essential for an economy to consider the below and sufficiently address\nthem, based on their monetary policies and objectives, before issuing CBDC to\nits public. BIS has drawn importance to the three important foundational\nprinciples for central banks to consider in issuing a CBDC:\na) It should not interfere with public policy objectives or prevent banks from\nperforming their monetary stability mandate (a “do no harm” principle).\nb) It should be used alongside and complement existing forms of money (the\ncoexistence principle).\nc) It should promote innovation and competition to increase the overall efficiency\nand accessibility of the payment system (the innovation and efficiency\nprinciple).\nApart from the above, the following concerns cannot be ignored as well.\ni. CBDCs to be account-based or token-based?\nA token based CBDC is the digital equivalent of a banknote. A token CBDC is a\n“bearer-instrument”. Whoever holds them would own them. An account-based\nsystem would require the keeping of a record of balances and transactions of all\nholders of the CBDC and indicate the ownership of the monetary balances. As\nregards verification, a person receiving a token will verify that his ownership of\nthe token is genuine, whereas an intermediary verifies the identity of an account\nholder.\nii. Anonymity.\nPhysical currency represents anonymity, universality and finality. However,\nensuring anonymity for a digital currency is a challenge as they leave a trail.\nThe degree of anonymity is key. Central banks around the world have\nexpressed concern over fully anonymous CBDC which paves way for illegal\ntransactions. The European Central Bank experimented an intermediate degree\nof anonymity by allotting some anonymous vouchers that could be used for\nsmall transactions and larger transactions were still monitored.\niii. Fixed Denomination v. Minimum Value based CBDC.\nAnother point of concern is whether a token maybe issued with minimum value\nor fixed denominations. While minimum value tokens might result in higher\nvolume transaction, fixed denominations on the other hand would help build the\n8same level of trust that people have in the physical currency of the same\ndenominations.\niv. Technology.\nThe platform should ideally have the following features:\n• Highly scalable to support very high volume and rate of transactions without\nperformance degradation.\n• Robust to ensure stability of financial ecosystem\n• Tamper-proof access control protocols and Cryptography for safety of data,\nboth CBDC and transactional data\n• Cross platform support, to allow development of large variety of client\napplications using CBDC for financial services\n• Ability to integrate with other IT platforms in the financial ecosystem must be at\nthe core of platform design\n• Configurable workflows for quick implementation of policy level directives\nissued by RBI from time to time\n• Comprehensive administration, reporting, and data analytics utilities\n• Highly evolved fraud monitoring framework to prevent occurrence of financial\nfrauds\nv. Recoverability\nIn case of token based models, where mere possession of the token proves\nownership, it is essential to consider the consequence in case of loss.\n• Custodian model – Service provider shall be responsible for managing the\nwallet. In case of a loss, the wallet shall be recovered by using the wallet\naddress, pin etc. The security of the wallet shall depend on the technology of\nthe service provider.\n• User held model – The responsibility of safeguarding and managing the keys\nit that of the user and the device. The wallet is not recoverable in case of a loss\nof the device.\nvi. Offline functionality.\nAccess to internet is still not achieved in some areas and the people in select\nregions would not be able to use CBDC merely due to lack of connectivity. To\ncombat this hindrance, it is vital for offline capabilities to be incorporated.\nvii. Business Continuity Planning.\nCBDCs carry the sovereign guarantee, therefore, it is more than vital that the\nBusiness Continuity Planning of CBDC would need to be of the highest\nstandard. Business continuity infrastructure and planning would have be in\nplace and implemented at the central bank as well as all other players in the\necosystem.\n9viii. Consumer protection.\nThe very concept of a digital currency can only be as effective as its consumer\nprotection and grievance handling mechanisms. Some risks associated with\nCBDC are:\n• Privacy - While combatting AML and having CFT mechanisms in place, the\nCMDC platform and the authorities need to be conscious of protecting the users’\nprivacy.\n• Security and technology risks - The importance of security in a concept such\nas CBDC cannot be overstated. Also, while most of the technology underlying\nit may be beyond understanding for an average consumer, regular and\nappropriate technical audit is necessary.\n• Accountability - The identification of who is accountable to consumers in case\nof loss is crucial and a core issue in respect of the consumer protections\nassociated risk.\nVIII. Conclusion:\nSeveral central banks across the world are still in conceptual or pilot stages.\nWhile RBI has taken stock of the potential of virtual currencies and is now in pilot\nstages, the reality of CBDC is still tests and consultations away.

By some estimates, there are over 10 million\ncrypto-asset owners in India and the number is rising. Trading in crypto-assets is not prohibited.\nHowever, there is no regulatory framework for this trade either. Several cryptocurrency exchanges\noperate in India, including CoinSwitch Kuber, WazirX, Zebpay and CoinDCX. Investors also have\naccess to foreign crypto exchanges such as i\u0000nex.\nIncomes derived from trading in crypto-assets were taxable under the normal provisions of the\nIncome Tax Act, 1961 (act). However, from 1 April 2022, incomes accruing from the transfer of VDAs\nare subject to the new tax regime.\nVDAs are widely de\u0000ned as any information, code, number or token (not being o\u0000cial currency),\ngenerated through cryptographic means or otherwise, providing a digital representation of value\nwhich is exchanged with or without consideration, or functions as a store of value or a unit of accountand includes its use in any nancial transaction or investment, and can be transferred, stored or\ntraded electronically; a non-fungible token (NFT) or any other token of a similar nature; and any other\ndigital asset as may be noti ed by the government.\nNFTs are blockchain-based digital units used to transfer or validate ownership of unique digitally-\ncollectable items, such as celebrity autographs, photos or videos of iconic events. Each NFT is unique\nand not interchangeable with another digital token and exists as a cryptographic record on a\nblockchain. Thus, every kind of digital asset that can be transferred, stored or traded electronically is\ne\u0000ectively covered by the de\u0000nition of VDAs.\nUnder the new regime, income accruing to any person from the transfer of VDAs will be subject to\ntax at a at rate of 30%, with no deduction allowed for any expense other than the purchase price of\nthe VDA. The new provisions apply whether the VDAs are held as capital assets or as trading assets.\nThus, even if a person holds VDAs as capital assets and not as stock in trade, the income accruing\nfrom the transfer of VDAs will be taxed at a at rate of 30% and not at the rate of 20% which is\napplicable to long term capital gains.\nLosses arising from the transfer of VDAs will not be deductible for computing taxable income on the\ntransfer of VDAs. Further, losses from the transfer of VDAs will not be allowed to be set o\u0000 against\nany other income nor will they be allowed to be carried forward and set o\u0000 against income of future\nyears. While income from the transfer of VDAs has become taxable the taxpayer will get no relief in\nrespect of losses arising from their transfer.\nThe new provisions impose a liability on the buyers of VDAs to withhold tax at the rate of 1% of the\ntransfer consideration when remitting the transfer consideration to any Indian tax resident. However,\nif the payment for the transfer of VDA is either wholly in kind or in exchange for another VDA and not\nin cash, or partly in cash and partly in kind and the cash component is not su cient to meet the tax\nliability the buyer is required to ensure that the tax due has been paid by the seller in respect of the\ntransaction before remitting the transfer consideration to them.\nHowever, there will be no liability to withhold tax on the transfer of VDAs where the consideration is\npayable by a speci\u0000ed individual and the aggregate value does not exceed INR50,000 (USD645) during\nany nancial year, and where the consideration payable for the transfer of the VDAs does not exceed\nINR10,000 during any nancial year.\nLastly, an amendment to section 56 of the act provides that if any person receives a gift of VDAs in\nany nancial year and their aggregate fair market value exceeds INR50,000 then the fair market valuein excess of INR50,000 will be taxed as income of the recipient at the applicable slab rate.\nShahid Khan is a senior partner at Kochhar & Co.\nKochhar & Co\nNew Delhi (head o\u0000ce):\nSuite # 1120 -21, 11th Floor, Tower – A\nDLF Towers, Jasola District Center\nJasola – 110 025, India\nIndia o\u0000ces:\nNew Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Chennai, Gurugram and Hyderabad\nOverseas o\u0000ces:\nDubai, Singapore, Chicago and Jeddah\nContact details:\nTel:+91 11 4111 5222, +91 11 4312 9300\nEmail:\ndelhi@kochhar.com\ninfo@kochhar.com"}

and\n• By 2% in the rest of Maharashtra; and\n(ii) For the period commencing from January 1, 2021 till March 31, 2021:\n• By 2% in Mumbai and Mumbai Suburban Districts; and\n• By 1.5% in the rest of Maharashtra.\nThis essentially meant that the stamp duty payable on conveyances executed during\nSeptember 1, 2020 to March 31, 2021 in Maharashtra, would be calculated as per the\naforementioned rates (“Reduction”).\nPursuant to the Reduction being notified, several real estate developers claimed that the\nsame would also be applicable to development agreements executed by them with land-\nowners across Maharashtra.\n1However, this contention of the developers was not accepted by the concerned\nauthorities at the time.\nThe Case:\nOne such developer, Sandeep Dwellers Private Limited (“Developer”), appears to have\nentered into three development agreements in respect of immoveable properties located\nin Nagpur, all executed in and around December 2020 (“DAs”).\nAt the time of submitting the DAs for adjudication, the Developer had raised the aforesaid\ncontention of availing the prescribed Reduction benefit.\nThe adjudicating authority did not recognize the DAs to be at par with a ‘conveyance’\nand as such, rejected the Developer’s aforesaid contention.\nThus, the Developer had no choice but to pay the stamp duty prescribed under the\nadjudicating authority’s order dated December 12, 2020 (“Impugned Order”) and\nregister the DAs.\nThereafter, vide its Writ Petition No. 3622 of 2021 filed before the Nagpur Bench of the\nHon’ble Bombay High Court, the Developer challenged the legality and correctness of\nthe Impugned Order, inter alia claiming refund of the excess stamp duty that was\nwrongfully prescribed by the adjudicating authority without accounting for the Reduction\nbenefit.\nThis was opposed by the Learned Assistant Government Pleader on the grounds that the\nDeveloper had already paid stamp duty, duly adjudicated as per the Impugned Order\nand as such, was not entitled to seek any refund in that regard, claiming to have paid\nexcess stamp duty.\nThe Analysis:\nThe Hon’ble Court observed that the Developer had entered into the DAs with the land\n- owners, on an area-sharing basis.\nUnder the DAs, several rights and liabilities had been created in favour of the Developer\nwith respect to the corresponding immovable properties which were akin to transfer of\nimmovable property.\nAs such, the Hon’ble Court opined that the DAs were conveyances within the meaning\nof the definition of the term under Section 2 (g) of the Act which includes, “instruments\nwhereunder any interest in any immoveable property is transferred to any person and\nwhich is not otherwise specifically provided under Schedule I of the Act”.\nThe Verdict:\nThe Hon’ble Court held that the DAs would have to be treated at par with an instrument\nof conveyance and hence they were squarely covered by the aforesaid notification dated\nAugust 29, 2020.\n2Since all the DAs were executed on or before December 31, 2020, they would be eligible\nfor a concession of stamp duty to the extent of 2% (two percent), as prescribed under\nthe aforesaid notification dated August 29, 2020 in respect of immoveable properties\nlocated in the ‘rest of Maharashtra’ i.e. outside Mumbai and Mumbai’s Suburban Districts.\nThe fact that the Developer had complied with the Impugned Order and paid the\nprescribed stamp duty thereunder would not defeat the Developer’s rights to claim the\nReduction benefit.\nThe Hon’ble Court found the Impugned Order to be illegal which was, therefore, quashed\nand set aside.\nIllation:\nBy way of the above judgment, the Hon’ble Bombay High Court has categorically clarified\nthat the DAs would fall within the purview of the definition of conveyances as per Section\n2(g) of the Act.\nThus, one could say that similar development agreements executed between September\n1, 2020 and March 31, 2021 would also be eligible to the benefit of Reduction prescribed\nunder the aforesaid notification dated August 29, 2020.\nAs such, to seek benefit of the Reduction, developers may apply to the competent\nauthorities for claiming refund of any excess stamp duty paid in respect of their\ndevelopment agreements, provided that:\n(i) the rights and liabilities created in favour of and against the concerned developers\nunder such development agreements are akin to transfer of immoveable property in\nfavour of the concerned developers; and\n(ii) the benefit of Reduction was not availed by the developer / concerned parties at the\ntime of stamping such development agreement/s.\nDisclaimer: This is for information purpose only and is not intended to be an advertisement or solicitation.\nIt is not a substitute for professional advice.

{"Title": "Supreme Court Ruling Sets the Foundation for GST on Secondment of Employees", "Publication_Date": "5 July 2022", "URL": "https://kochhar.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Supreme-Court-Ruling-Sets-the-Foundation-for-GST-on-Secondment-of-Employees_Insights_Taxation_July-2022.pdf", "Content": "Supreme Court Ruling Sets the Foundation for GST on Secondment of Employees\nAUTHOR: REENA ASTHANA KHAIR\nSENIOR PARTNER AND HEAD INTERNATIONAL TRADE & INDIRECT TAXATION\nKOCHHAR & CO.\nEMAIL: reena.khair@kochhar.com\nJapanese Multinational companies often share their talent pool across borders and jurisdictions by\nsecondment of Japanese nationals. This enables the group to understand cultural differences and for\nthe affiliates to take advantage of the experience of the parent or group company. It also creates an\nopportunity to strengthen the relationship within the group.\nA secondment is an arrangement, where an employee has a relationship both with the seconding and\nhost Company. As an example, a Japanese multinational, may provide an employee on secondment to\nan Indian subsidiary / group company. During the period of secondment, the employee’s status with the\nOverseas Group company is dormant, as if the employee is on long leave, and that with the Indian\nCompany (‘Host Company’) is active. The employee remains on the payrolls of the Group company in\nJapan and receives its salary in Japan. The Indian Company or host reimburses the whole or part of\nthe salary of the employee to the Group Company in Japan. The seconded employee operates and\nworks under the control and supervision of the host company. On completion of secondment, the\nemployee reverts to the Group Company.\nThe Service Tax authorities have in the past contended that host company receives ‘manpower\nservices’, for which the host company pays a consideration, in the form of reimbursement of salary to\nthe overseas Group company. The CESTAT (Customs, Excise & Service Tax Appellate Tribunal) has\nruled, that in a secondment, an employer- employee relationship comes into existence between the\nseconded employee and the host, and hence there is no supply of manpower.\nThe Supreme Court of India in a recent ruling, in the case of Commissioner of Customs, Central Excise\n& Service Tax-Bangalore (Adjudication) Vs. M/s Northern Operating Systems Pvt. Ltd. has made a\ndeparture from this settled legal position and held that service tax is applicable, on secondment of\nemployees by an Overseas Company to an Indian Company, where the salary is disbursed by the\nOverseas Company and the same is later reimbursed by the Indian Company on actuals.\nThe Supreme Court Decision in The Northern Operating Case\nIn the Northern Operating case, the Indian host Company was providing Backoffice Support Services,\nto the Overseas Group Company and seconded employees were working in connection with these\nBackoffice Support Services.\n1The Court held that the crux of the issue is the taxability of the cross charge, which is primarily based on\nwho should be reckoned as an employer of the secondee. The critical fact was that overseas group\ncompanies’ business was to secure contracts, which can be performed by its highly trained and skilled\npersonnel. Accordingly, the Overseas Group Company would enter into contracts with host companies,\nfor providing such services, by seconding its employees.\nThe Court noted that the overseas employer, deploys the employees to the host company on\nsecondment, in relation to its own business. Further, the overseas employer, pays them their salaries.\nTheir terms of employment – even during the secondment – are in accord with the policy of the overseas\ncompany, who is their employer. Upon the end of the period of secondment, they return to their original\nplaces, to await deployment or extension of secondment.\nConsidering the above arrangement, the Supreme Court held that quid pro quo is implicit, as both the\nparties are deriving economic benefit from the arrangement. The Overseas Company gets the benefit of\nquality work from the Indian Company and the Indian Company is able to get business due to presence\nof expert seconded employees. In this context, the Court held that secondment of employees is a taxable\nservice of ‘manpower supply’.\nOur view on Implications under the GST regime\nThis decision is significant as it upsets the previous jurisprudence on the issue of taxability of\nreimbursements for seconded employees. The Supreme Court has treated secondment as a manpower\nsupply, only where the seconded employees are involved in the provision of a service by the host Indian\ncompany to the overseas company. While this ruling may not apply to all cases of secondment, it will\nopen such transactions for scrutiny, having regard to the overall arrangement between the parties,\nespecially as the authorities are likely to apply this ruling to current transactions under GST.\nJapanese Companies will need to revisit the clauses of their inter-company services agreements,\nsecondment agreements, and letters issued to seconded employees, especially in cases where the\nIndian host Company is providing a service to the Overseas Company, and seconded employees are\nworking in relation to such service. Companies will also need to maintain necessary documentation for\nidentifying the purpose of secondment keeping in mind this judgment.\n2"}

It is a simulated\ndigital environment that encompasses a network of 3D virtual worlds focused on social\nconnection. Non-fungible tokens and their underlying technology have surged the market value of\ndigital assets. From gaming to art and e-commerce, every industry has started to enter the\nmetaverse sphere to explore the endless opportunities it has to offer.\nThere prevails a dual mindset of companies, where few are eager and contemplating offering\ngoods and services to the public in the metaverse and few that rather wait it out and fully\nunderstand the implications that is to come by trading in the digital virtual market. While this battle\nis ongoing on one side, leading brands such as AJIO, WALMART, VOGUE, etc. have entered the\nvirtual market and furthermore applied for trademark protection in India under Classes 9, 35 and\n42. The classification of goods and services under the NICE Classification ranges from classes 1\nto 34 for goods and 35 to 45 for services. Although, the underlying nature of goods/ services\nbecomes secondary in this context and channel of distribution takes precedence. Thus,\napplications are being filed with relevant descriptions under class 9 - ‘downloadable virtual goods,\nnamely computer programs’, class 35 – retail store services featuring virtual goods and class 42 –\non-line non downloadable virtual goods and NFTs, respectively. Additionally, companies apply\nunder class 36 for financial services, including digital tokens, for facilitating trade in the virtual\nmarketplace. Based on the noticeable pattern, it is safe to assume that a separate bracketed\ncategory of ‘virtual goods’ and ‘digital collectibles’ has emerged.\nThe term ‘digital product’ has been used in commercial law but the term itself is not defined,\nleaving it open to interpretation.\n• Policy regarding Foreign Direct Investment use the said term in the definition of ‘E-commerce’,\nwhich reads ‘E-commerce means buying and selling of goods and services including digital\nproducts over digital & electronic network’. The rules further capture the definition of\n‘Marketplace based model of e-commerce’ – that recognizes the platform that facilitates digital\nsale of goods and services.\n• Consumer Protection (E-Commerce) Rules, 2020 provides rules regulating all goods and\nservices bought or sold over digital or electronic network including digital products, including\nall models of e-commerce acting as a facilitator.\nHowever, the Finance Act, 2022 defines ‘virtual digital asset’ as\n(a) any information or code or number or token (not being Indian currency or foreign currency),\ngenerated through cryptographic means or otherwise, by whatever name called, providing a\ndigital representation of value exchanged with or without consideration, with the promise or\nPage 1 of 2representation of having inherent value, or functions as a store of value or a unit of account\nincluding its use in any financial transaction or investment, but not limited to investment scheme;\nand can be transferred, stored or traded electronically;\n(b) a non-fungible token or any other token of similar nature, by whatever name called;\n(c) any other digital asset, as the Central Government may, by notification in the Official Gazette\nspecify:\nProvided that the Central Government may, by notification in the Official Gazette, exclude any\ndigital asset from the definition of virtual digital asset subject to such conditions as may be\nspecified therein.\nExplanation.–– For the purposes of this clause,––\n(a) “non-fungible token” means such digital asset as the Central Government may, by notification\nin the Official Gazette, specify;\n(b) the expressions “currency”, “foreign currency” and “Indian currency” shall have the same\nmeanings as respectively assigned to them in clauses (h), (m) and (q) of section 2 of the Foreign\nExchange Management Act, 1999.’\nWith advancement in technology and widening the marketplace horizon demands appropriate\nlegislations, robust policies and other terms and licenses governing the transaction of goods and\nservices in the metaverse and the limited rights that flow with it. Inevitably, the present invasion\nposes challenges to the trademark sphere such as, unauthorised use of trademarks, ownership,\nrights, jurisdiction, etc. If the trademark issues in the metaverse are handled without care, it may\ncause dilution and bring harm to the goodwill and reputation of the trademark owner accrued in\nthe conventional market. By filing a trademark application under the aforesaid relevant classes,\nan entity should be able to enforce its rights in the metaverse as well.\nWe are hopeful that, as trademark offices and relevant forums receive applications/ disputes of\nsuch nature and are prosecuted/ adjudicated upon, a series of reasonably accepted standard\npractice is developed over a period of time which will act as a guideline and eventually find its\nplace in respective legislation. This will encourage companies to come forward and join the digital\nvirtual market.\nCONTACT DETAILS:\nLynn Lazaro, Partner\nlynn.lazaro@bgl.kochhar.com\nAparna Venkat, Associate\naparna.venkat@bgl.kochhar.com\nPage 2 of 2"}

Accordingly, as per Section 60(1) of IBC, even when no CIRP or liquidation\nproceedings are pending against a principal borrower/ Corporate Debtor, an application against its\nguarantor can still be filed in the NCLT which has territorial jurisdiction over the place where the\nregistered office of principal borrower/ Corporate Debtor is situated. The NCLAT further clarified that the\npurpose and object of Section 60(2) of IBC is that when CIRP or liquidation proceedings are pending in\na particular NCLT against a Corporate Debtor, any proceeding against its guarantor should also be filed\nbefore the same NCLT (idea being both proceedings are tried by same NCLT), and this does not in any\nway prohibit filing of proceedings under Section 95 of the Code even if no proceedings are pending\nbefore NCLT against the Corporate Debtor.\nThe above judgment of the NCLAT was carried in appeal to the Supreme Court. While initially vide order\ndated March 21, 20223, the Supreme Court had stayed the operation of the NCLAT’s order by relying\non the decision of Lalit Kumar Jain vs. Union of India & Ors.

The Explanatory Memorandum states that\nwhile the Commission had introduced the Renewable Energy Certificates (“REC”) in the Indian electricity sector\nby notifying the erstwhile REC Regulations of 2010, however, since such introduction, power sector in India has\nwitnessed significant changes and the REC Regulations, 2022 have been framed as there was a need to revisit\nthe REC Mechanism in order to align with emerging scenarios in the power sector and to promote new\nrenewable energy technologies.\nProvided below is a table containing the relevant provisions under the REC Regulations, 2022 and the rationale\nbehind their framing as enumerated in the Explanatory Memorandum for ready reference of stakeholders:\nS.

Accordingly, the\nperforming functions as provided under Commission has designated the NLDC to\nthese regulations. perform the functions of Central Agency under\nthe new REC mechanism.\n1 https://cercind.gov.in/regulations/REC-Regulations-2022.pdf\n1(2) The functions of the Central Agency shall be\nto:\ni. undertake registration of eligible\nentities,\nii. develop a mechanism for accounting\nof generation and sale in respect of\nCertificates;\niii. undertake issuance of Certificates,\niv. maintain and settle accounts in\nrespect of Certificates,\nv. act as repository of transactions in\nCertificates,\nvi. maintain Registry of Certificates,\nvii. perform such other functions\nincidental to sub-clauses (i) to (vi) of\nthis clause,\nviii. and\nix. undertake any other function that may\nbe assigned by the Commission.\n2. 4. Eligibility for Issuance of Certificates\n(1) Following entities shall be eligible for Primary criteria for the entity to be eligible\nissuance of Certificates: under REC mechanism are that the entity\n(a) Renewable energy generating stations, should be engaged in generation of electricity\n(b) Captive generating stations based on from approved RE sources and connected to\nrenewable energy sources, the grid.\n(c) Distribution licensees, and\n(d) Open access consumers\n(2) A renewable energy generating station shall Tariff determined under Section 62 or Section\nbe eligible for issuance of Certificates, if it 63 of the Electricity Act, 2003 (“Act”) for a\nmeets the following conditions: renewable energy generating station takes into\n(a) the tariff of such renewable energy account the cost of generation and risks\ngenerating station, for part or full involved during the lifetime of the operation of\ncapacity, has not been either determined a renewable generation station. Further,\nor adopted under section 62 or section distribution licensee procures electricity from\n63 of the Act respectively, or the RE generating station whose tariff is\nelectricity generated is not sold directly determined or adopted under Section 62 or 63\nor through an electricity trader or in the for fulfilment of its renewable purchase\nPower Exchange, for RPO compliance obligation (RPO).

Accordingly, renewable\nenergy generating station should not have\navailed any (i) waiver or concessional\ntransmission charges or (ii) waiver of or\nconcessional wheeling charges.\n(3) A captive generating station based on Under REC Regulations, 2022, all captive\nrenewable energy sources and meeting the generating stations based on renewable\nconditions as specified under clause (2) of energy sources are allowed to participate in the\nthis Regulation in respect of renewable REC mechanism irrespective of its date of\nenergy generating station shall be eligible for commissioning subject to the condition that the\nissuance of Certificates: RECs issued up to self-consumption shall not\nbe eligible for sale but can be used only to\nProvided that the Certificates issued to such offset RPO of such CGSs.

Such self-\nconsumption actually replaces the equivalent\nprocurement from the distribution licensee and\nhence gets adequately compensated in terms\nof saving on the tariff applicable for such\nconsumer category. Hence, the Certificates\nissued to such captive generating stations to\nthe extent of self-consumption, shall not be\neligible for sale in the REC Market. For the\ngeneration component which beyond the self-\nconsumption from such captive generating\nstations, it could be treated like a sale to any\nthird party by any renewable generating station\nand would hence be eligible for REC.\n(4) An obligated entity being a distribution Issuance of certificates to the distribution\nlicensee or an open access consumer, companies is an inducement for procurement\nwhich purchases electricity from renewable of renewable energy beyond their renewable\nenergy sources in excess of the renewable purchase obligation.

There have been demands for\none Megawatt hour of electricity generated and incentivising higher cost RE sources such as\ninjected or deemed to be injected into the Municipal Solid Waste (MSW), Biomass, hydro\ngrid. etc. The Commission has taken note of these\nfeedbacks and accordingly decided that\nrenewable energy-based projects would\nreceive a common but differentiated by number\nof Certificate(s), by way of Certificate multiplier\nbased on maturity and cost of a particular\ntechnology. This will ensure that REC market is\nnot fragmented while making sure at the same\ntime that all technologies are equitably\ncompensated.

The communication\nreceived from the Ministry of Power also\nrecommended removal of floor and\nforbearance price. Accordingly, the\nCommission has decided to do away with the\nrequirement of determining floor and\nforbearance price for REC. The price of REC\nwould be discovered based on the demand and\nsupply situation in the REC market with\ncomplete freedom to buyers and sellers. The\nCommission believes that this will help realize\ntrue market value of REC.\nIn order to ensure there is no gaming or\nmalpractice leading to manipulation of prices in\nthe REC market, a sperate provision for\nRegulatory intervention is provided under sub-\nclause (2) of Regulation 13.\n9. 14.

(https://kochhar.com)\nCaptive power generation in the Indian solar sector is, literally, a hotbed of policy and regulatory\ncontradiction. While the Electricity Act, 2003 (“Act”) incentivises captive power generation, losing\nlucrative industrial and commercial customers to captive power consumption is a deeply unpopular\noutcome for our financially beleaguered state power distribution and transmission companies\nwhich rely on high industrial tariffs paid by such customers. As a consequence, notwithstanding\nthe statutory lure of financial incentives to captive power generators (such as non-discriminatory\nopen access and the waiver of onerous cross subsidy surcharges) and the promise of\nuninterrupted captive power supply, the “captive status” of power producers is routinely subjected\nto scrutiny, denial of benefits and judicial challenge by (state owned) power distribution companies\n(“Discoms”).\nThe Electricity Act read with the Electricity Rules, 2005 provide that in order for a power project to\nqualify as a captive generating plant, captive user(s) must maintain at least 26% of the ownership\nof the project (i.e., equity share capital with voting rights) and ensure that at least 51% of the\naggregate electricity generated in such plant, determined on an annual basis, is consumed for\ncaptive use. However, the qualifying criteria above are a perennial subject of interpretative\n1contention between power producers and Discoms, often resulting in a ‘cat and mouse’ exercise\nin innovative “structuring” by captive users on the one hand and denial, by Discoms, of group\ncaptive status/open access/waiver of cross subsidy surcharge to power producers on the other.\nAgainst this backdrop, a new judgment of Supreme Court on May 12, 2022 in Chhattisgarh State\nPower Distribution Company Ltd. vs. Chhattisgarh State Electricity Regulatory Commission & Anr.\n(“SC Judgment”) serves as a welcome reprieve to captive power producers by reading down the\ntest of proportionality prescribed for group captive plants set up by an ‘association of persons’ or\n“AOP”.\nThe SC Judgment settles, with some finality, a longstanding contention by Discoms that for a\ncaptive user to avail of open access and wheeling through a public transmission network, the\nusage of power produced by the concerned off-takers should be directly proportional to the captive\nusers’ share of ownership of the plant, within a permissible variation of 10%. In the present case,\nChhattisgarh State Power Distribution Company Ltd (“CSPDCL”) relied on a proviso in the\nElectricity Rules mandating proportionality of offtake by an AOP, to contend that disproportionate\nofftake inter-se by group captive users would negate the plant’s claim to captive status.\nIt may be noted that for a “captive” power plant, the Electricity Rules provides that “not less than\n26% of the ownership is held by the captive user(s), and not less than 51% of the aggregate\nelectricity generated in such plant, determined on an annual basis, is consumed for the captive\nuse”. However, the proviso to the foregoing Regulation states that if (multiple) off-taker(s) are an\nAOP, the aforesaid qualifying offtake requirement (i.e., a minimum of 51% of the total power\nproduced) would apply in proportion to the captive users’ respective shareholding/ownership of the\npower plant.\nIn the specific facts of the SC Judgment, 72% the power plant claiming captive status was owned\nby Shri Bajrang Power and Ispat Ltd. (“SBPIL”) while its sister concern Shri Bajrang Metallics and\nPower Ltd. (“SBMPL”) owned 27.6% of the plant. However, when it came to power consumption,\nSBPIL consumed just 14.16% of the power produced while SBMPL consumed 57.87%. CSPDPL\nargued that as the drawal of power was not proportionate to SBPIL and SBMPL’s respective\nownership of the power plant (as required by the Electricity Rules) the power plant did not qualify\nas “captive” and – accordingly - would not be entitled to open access or a waiver of cross subsidy\nsurcharge for the transmission of the power produced.\nDismissing CSPDCL’s appeal, the Supreme Court affirmed the paramountcy of the twin tests of\nminimum equity ownership (26%) and off-take (51%) for captive use (“Twin Tests”), reading down\nin the process the additional requirement of inter-se proportionality of usage and offtake between\ngroup captive users. In doing so, the SC Judgment settles a long pending bone of contention in\ncaptive projects involving multiple captive offtakers with disproportionate inter-se use, even while\nsatisfying the Twin Tests above.\nThe Supreme Court’s analysis was as follows:\n“20. Admittedly, SBMPL holds 27.6% equity shares in SBPIL. As such, the requirement of not less\nthan 26% of shares is fulfilled by SBMPL…..Since SBMPL holds 27.6% of the ownership, the use\nof electricity by it would be for captive use under the provisions of the said Act. The other\nrequirement would be that the consumption of SBIPL and SBMPL together should not be less than\n51% of the power generated. Admittedly, the joint consumption by SBIPL and SBMPL is more than\n51%. As such, both the conditions as provided under Rule 3 of the said Rules are satisfied.”\nCuriously, while ascribing weightage to the Twin Tests, the SC Judgment skirts the issue of\nwhether SBIPL and SBMPL are an AOP; or whether going forward the proviso in Regulation 3(1)\nmandating proportional power consumption by AOPs is a superfluous qualifying parameter in light\nof the ‘higher’ Twin Tests. On the contrary (and somewhat problematically) the Supreme Court\nconcludes that SBIPL and SBMPL are, in fact, an ‘association of persons’. If so, one could argue\nthat a captive plant is bound by the additional test of proportionality in the Electricity Rules, failing\nwhich the plant would qualify as ‘captive’.\n2The SC Judgment instead invokes the objects and purpose of the National Electricity Policy, 2005\nof securing reliable, quality and cost effective power and facilitate creation of employment\nopportunities, to conclude that “…the interpretation which advances the object and purpose of the\nAct, has to be preferred.”\nOur view\nBy favouring the Twin Tests in preference to the test of proportionality of use, the SC Judgment\nappears to have erased the distinction between captive power plants established by an AOP\nversus those established other than by AOP. The concluding implication of the SC Judgment\nseems to be that as long as the Twin Tests are satisfied, multiple captive users are not bound to\nadhere to consumption that is proportionate to their shareholding considering the object and\npurpose of the Act to facilitate captive power plants.\nDespite its flawed reasoning to brush proportionality of use aside, the SC Judgment is a welcome\nchange for embattled captive power plants, providing much-needed respite for group captive\nprojects involving multiple captive offtakers. However, despite the ostensible clarification offered\nby the SC, for abundant clarity it is advisable that project developers and off-takers should:\n• clearly identify and delineate the entity that is designated as ‘captive user(s)’, in\ncontradistinction to the entity that is the ‘project developer’;\n• specifically mention that the off-taker and developer have distinct commercial roles and\ndo not constitute an AOP with common purpose (even if the developer is an incidental\nconsumer of power from the captive plant, as in SBPIL’s case)\nSeparating, in clear contractual terms, the ‘project developer’ from the ‘captive offtaker(s)’ would\nprevent future confusion and the unwarranted disallowance of captive status and benefits by\nDiscoms through perverse arguments on qualification, entitlement and use.\n------------------------------------------------------\n3"}

{"Title": "NFTs Explained – Ownership, Licenses, and the Law", "Publication_Date": "15 March 2022", "URL": "https://kochhar.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/NFTs-Explained-Ownership-Licenses-and-the-Law_Insights_IPR_March-2022.pdf", "Content": "NFTs Explained – Ownership, Licenses, and the Law\nAUTHOR: LYNN LAZARO\nPARTNER, KOCHHAR & CO. BANGALORE OFFICE\nEMAIL: lynn.lazaro@bgl.kochhar.com\nNFTs have been around since 2015 on the Ethereum blockchain and have significantly grown over the\nyears especially in the digital art industry. However, not all NFTs are art related. Some NFTs are also\nattached to physical products where they could act like security.\n“NFT” basically stands for a “non-fungible token”. The wording “non-fungible” essentially means unique\nand cannot be replaced. So unlike, currency, bitcoin, etc., which are interchangeable, NFTs are one of\na kind. In the digital art space, NFTs are used to claim ownership on a piece of copyrightable work – be\nit a digital painting, photograph, design, and the like.\nIn 2021, Christie’s auction house sold an NFT of a digital artwork by Beeple, a relatively unknown artist\nat the time, for USD 69,346,250 to an anonymous buyer. Since then, there have been several questions\non what exactly was purchased through the NFT. Whether or not it was an actual purchase i.e., transfer\nof ownership of the IP, a licence to use the IP or a transfer of only the art, sans anything else.\nWho is the owner?\nOn purchasing an NFT on a piece of art, the purchaser is essentially granted a non-exclusive license to\ncertain intellectual property rights. This can include the number of copies that can be sold, royalty\npayments, etc. This license is granted by way of a smart contract. A smart contract, once created, is\nminted onto a token i.e., the NFT on the blockchain. A key aspect to note here is that once minted, the\nNFT is extremely difficult to be changed or amended. Therefore, the license terms on the contract need\nto be fool proof but more importantly globally acceptable. Copyright laws vary from country to country\nand a seemingly fool proof license may not be so outside the country of origin.\nIn addition, while people use the terms ‘purchase’ and ‘license’ interchangeably it is important to\nunderstand that while you are purchasing the NFT, you are not purchasing the copyright in the art itself.\nThere maybe a transfer of ownership of the digital art but there is no transfer of ownership of copyright.\nIt is only a license to use the product as per the license terms within the smart contract of the NFT. This\nis similar to the purchase of a painting for example. The copyright in the painting remains with the artist.\nWhile the ownership of the painting may change hands several times, the copyright of the owner is never\ntransferred.\nWhat’s the purpose?\n1So, one might question the need for an NFT if there isn’t a transfer of IP ownership. The idea behind the\nconcept is that the NFT acts as an insignia on the product, wherein the ownership of the product will be\nimprinted and verified through the blockchain. There can be no dispute as to the ownership of the\ncopyright, and the creator is entitled to royalty payments every time the license is invoked by the\nlicensees.\nNFT License\nThere is an NFT public license that is available freely. It is a basic license that covers the usual essential\nrights to be transferred. The language in this license provides for both general and commercial use. It’s\na boilerplate license and NFT owners can modify it according to their own purposes. However, as\nmentioned, copyright laws aren’t standard. While the basic law of ownership of copyright is generally the\nsame, in India specifically, there are requirements under the Copyright Act to include some obligatory\nlanguage for a copyright license.\nIf the terms of the NFT license is drafted without taking into account these nuances in the law, it might\nbecome increasingly difficult to rectify given that once minted, it would be a struggle to modify the NFT\nlicense. There is also no central law governing NFTs and while it’s become the hype and progressively\nmore popular among collectors, only existing IP, IT and contract law govern NFTs now. If an NFT is\nconsidered security or a derivative, then the NFT would be governed by the Indian Securities laws as\nwell. Another potential issue is jurisdiction. NFTs work on the blockchain where parties can maintain\ntheir anonymity and privacy. As IP laws remain territorial, interpreting and enforcing a NFT license\naccordingly would be interesting to say the least.\n2"}
